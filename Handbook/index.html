This agreement might be for the person to have set up a YouTube page to portray their personal journey and they might want staff to like their posts and send voice messages in support. This agreement is permissible if all staff are signed up to this but not if you are singled out to be the only person permitted to do this. This may impose on personal boundaries</p></li> <li><p>The use of social media to blog, comment, post or tweet about Tideway Care success is permitted within the following boundaries.

It is important that staff are skilled up to manage behaviours that challenge and fully comprehend the lone working policy and safeguards in place to provide support when it is require do reduce the risk of harm. It is vital that robust risk assessment and management practices become second nature and tacit for our staff in all situations.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="professional-boundaries"><a href="#professional-boundaries" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Professional boundaries</h2> <p>Working closely with vulnerable people means that you frequently get to know very intimate and personal details about them; this makes it more difficult to draw boundaries around your relationship with them as you develop very close and trusting relationships.</p> <p>It is for this reason we have frequent supervision with our staff to discuss these sorts of issues should they arise. Always utilise your supervision to share concerns or issues emerging, reflect on them and consider learnings.</p> <p>The following are some ways in which you must seek to keep your professional and personal boundaries with the people we support and their families:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Person centred</strong> - You are expected to place the needs of the person you are supporting at the centre of any decisions that you make about them and their lives. &quot;It's not about you&quot;!</p></li> <li><p>Self-disclosure. Information about yourself and your personal life should not be disclosed to the people you support or their families.</p></li> <li><p>Dual relationships. You should not hold more than one type of relationship with someone you support, for example, they cannot work for you, be a family member or receive extra private support from you, as well as be one of the people you support at Tideway Care.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="communications-and-keeping-up-to-date"><a href="#communications-and-keeping-up-to-date" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Communications and keeping up to date</h2> <p>Tideway Care believe that good communication is pivotal to working well and have the following internal communications and feedback methods for our staff:</p> <ul><li>Weekly Update Bulletins – news, lessons learnt, safety messages, etc</li> <li>Weekly Team Meetings</li> <li>Supervision sessions</li> <li>Staff fora</li> <li>Regular staff feedback surveys</li> <li>Tell Tideway – An always-open channel for any Feedback from <em>anyone</em></li></ul> <h2 id="leave-entitlement"><a href="#leave-entitlement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Leave entitlement</h2> <p>Tideway Care pay statutory requirements for staff leave entitlements, this is detailed in your contract of employment and covers the following:</p> <ul><li>Annual Leave</li> <li>Maternity</li> <li>Paternity</li> <li>Compassionate</li></ul> <h3 id="sickness-and-sick-pay"><a href="#sickness-and-sick-pay" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sickness and sick pay</h3> <ul><li>Staff are asked to report to their immediate line manager or nominated deputy as soon as it is clear they are not able to attend work</li> <li>Staff member can self- certificate for up to 7 days</li> <li>Staff members are required to send their line manager a completed doctor's sick certificate if the period of sickness is going to last more than 7 days.</li> <li>Staff members are required to notify their line manager as soon as they are aware that they can return to work.</li> <li>The manager will facilitate a return to work interview</li> <li>If you are too ill to work you are entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks paid by Tideway Care.</li> <li>To qualify for SSP and have been off work sick for 4 or more days in a row (including non-working days).</li></ul> <h2 id="pension"><a href="#pension" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Pension</h2> <ul><li>To help people save more for their retirement, all employers are now required by law to provide a workplace pension scheme for certain staff and pay money into it.</li> <li>You are eligible if you meet all of the following criteria:</li> <li>You earn over £192 per week (or £833 per month)</li> <li>You are aged 22 or over and</li> <li>You are under state pension age.</li> <li>You can opt out of the pension scheme if you want to, but if you stay in you will have your own personal pension when you retire.
