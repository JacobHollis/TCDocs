Introduction</h3> <p>Risks relating to a person’s Mental Health (MH) can be categorised as follows:</p> <p>a) At risk of harm to self<br>
b) At risk of harm to others<br>
c) Vulnerable to self-neglect<br>
d) Vulnerable to abuse from others</p> <p>Factors that can increase risk include the use of substances such as alcohol, cannabis, heroin, prescribed and non- prescribed medications such as Diazepam (Valium) or Tramadol (Pain relief) and also symptoms such as paranoia, auditory hallucinations and severe depression / anxiety. In addition, physical health risk can also impact adversely and to ensure a holistic approach identifying risk factors and managing them.</p> <p>It is unfortunate that people with a past history of violence, aggression, frequent self- harm, etc can be attributed with labels such as challenging, badly behaved or attention seeking. This is not helpful as such labels can negatively impact on outcomes. From a Positive Behaviour Support perspective, every behaviour has a meaning. Understanding triggers and what works at preventing risks is the key to reducing risk events. This guidance document therefore seeks to support a positive framework for assessing and managing risks.</p> <h3 id="_2-definition"><a href="#_2-definition" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Definition</h3> <p>MH risk is defined as:</p> <blockquote><p><strong>‘The potential for the occurrence of harm with respect to self - -harm or attempted suicide, violence,  neglect of self or dependents, abuse and exploitation of or by others (including sexual abuse, emotional and child abuse)’</strong>  (Webster, 1995).</p></blockquote> <p>Department of Health guidance (2008) indicates that all service users should receive an assessment, which includes the assessment of clinical risk. Therefore, many of the people we support will have had previous risk assessments and management plans in place in the past or currently. It is important to take these into consideration when formulating programmes.</p> <p>In addition;</p> <p>People with autism can also be at risk of harm to themselves or others as a result of the following:</p> <ol><li>Self Injury</li> <li>Physical health issues - PICA  (eating or mouthing non-edible items) and higher proportion of physical health LTCs</li> <li>Physical challenging behaviour such as biting, spitting, hitting and hair pulling</li> <li>Infection - Smearing</li></ol> <h3 id="_3-best-practice"><a href="#_3-best-practice" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3.  Best Practice</h3> <p>Our processes and monitoring of implementation in relation to Risk Assessment and Management will be underpinned by the national NHS guidance. Please refer to appendix A - Principles of best practice (Department of Health, 2007(2))</p> <h3 id="_4-tools-and-processes"><a href="#_4-tools-and-processes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Tools and processes</h3> <p>Staff should only use risk assessment tools that have been approved for use within Tideway Care.
The standard format used is found on share point for staff to use.
A suite of physical healthcare record forms are also available and include: fluid intake, falls assessment, weight, etc.</p> <h3 id="_5-risk-assessment-and-management-plan"><a href="#_5-risk-assessment-and-management-plan" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Risk Assessment and management plan</h3> <p>Assessment needs to be individual to the person’s own context for behaviour patterns or situational responses. Specific previous history of risk behaviours needs to be described as accurately and as fully as possible. Staff should make use of information that is reasonably available to them and this will vary from service to service and setting to setting. Risk behaviours should be considered in the context of environment, frequency, severity and patterns of behaviour. Every identified risk requires an attributable goal and actions detailed in the peple we support’s programmes to mitigate against the risk and agree ways to minimise.</p> <p>The more we engage the people we support in discussing risk assessments the more likely you will be able to engage them in seeking effective risk management plans. All too often the people we support will disagree with clinical risk assessments and reports from professionals; this may have to do with the negative language used. We therefore reframe risk assessment as identifying concerns and risk management as managing concerns.</p> <p>The Tideway Care risk assessment tool will aid the staff to identify key areas of risk for each of the people we support.</p> <h3 id="_6-positive-risk-taking"><a href="#_6-positive-risk-taking" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Positive risk taking</h3> <p>In all instances where positive risk taking may benefit the recovery of the people we support, the plan will outline the positive risk-taking actions discussed and agreed with the people we support.</p> <h3 id="_7-reviewing-risk-and-concerns"><a href="#_7-reviewing-risk-and-concerns" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7. Reviewing risk and concerns</h3> <p>Reviews of risk assessments and the programme should be in line with support needs reviews and CPA reviews. In addition, a risk assessment must be undertaken when there is a significant change or where a person is transitioning to a new service or big change in their circumstances.</p> <h3 id="_8-working-with-partner-agencies"><a href="#_8-working-with-partner-agencies" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 8. Working with partner agencies</h3> <p>Sharing risk with other agencies and partners is essential for joined up working. Most national enquiries cite poor communication between agencies as a key factor when things go wrong. It is not acceptable to hide behind confidentiality policies as they all should state that information is shared on a need to know basis. We encourage staff to raise and share concerns they may have about a people we support and to be persistent if they expect a response and there is none or an inadequate one.</p> <p>All staff should have the courage to speak up about things they are concerned about; even if it is a ‘gut feeling’; in addition, all staff should therefore learn to trust their colleague’s instincts and respond to concerns raised.</p> <p>Where required services should have local protocols in place to agree communication channels and key people on each organisation to escalate concerns to.</p> <h3 id="principles-of-best-practice-department-of-health-2007-2"><a href="#principles-of-best-practice-department-of-health-2007-2" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Principles of best practice (Department of Health, 2007(2))</h3> <ul><li>Best practice involves making decisions based on knowledge of the research evidence, knowledge of the individual service user and their social context, knowledge of the service user’s own experience, and clinical judgement;</li> <li>Positive risk management as part of a carefully constructed plan is a required competence for all mental health practitioners;</li> <li>Risk management should be conducted in a spirit of collaboration and based on a relationship between the service user and their carers that is as trusting as possible;</li> <li>Risk management must be built on recognition of the service user’s strengths and should emphasise recovery;</li> <li>Risk management requires an organisational strategy as well as efforts by the individual practitioner;</li> <li>Risk management involves developing flexible strategies aimed at preventing any negative event from occurring or, if this is not possible, minimising the harm caused;</li> <li>Risk management should take into account that risk can be both general and specific, and that good management can reduce and prevent harm;</li> <li>Knowledge and understanding of mental health legislation is an important component of risk management;</li> <li>The risk management plan should include a summary of all relevant risks identified, formulations of the situations in which identified risks may occur, and actions to be taken by practitioners and the service user in response to crisis;</li> <li>Risk assessment is integral to deciding on the most appropriate level of risk management and the right kind of intervention for a service user;</li> <li>All staff involved in risk management must be capable of demonstrating sensitivity and competence in relation to diversity in race, faith, age, gender, disability and sexual orientation;</li> <li>Risk management must always be based on awareness of the capacity for the service user’s risk level to change over time, and recognition that each service user requires a consistent and individualised approach;</li> <li>Risk management plans should be developed by multidisciplinary and multi agency teams operating in an open, democratic and transparent culture that embraces reflective practice;</li> <li>A risk management plan is only as good as the time and effort put into communicating its findings to others.</li></ul> <h3 id="principles-of-positive-risk-management"><a href="#principles-of-positive-risk-management" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Principles of positive risk management</h3> <p>These principles include, but are not limited to:</p> <ul><li>Working with the service user to identify what is likely to work;</li> <li>Paying attention to the views of carers and others around the service user when deciding a plan of action;</li> <li>Weighing up the potential benefits and harms of choosing one action over another;</li> <li>Being willing to take a decision that involves an element of risk because the potential positive benefits outweigh the risk;</li> <li>Being clear to all involved about the potential benefits and the potential risks;</li> <li>Developing plans and actions that support the positive potentials and priorities stated by the service user, and minimise the risks to the service user or others;</li> <li>Ensuring that the service user, carer and others who might be affected are fully informed of the decision, the reasons for it and the associated plans;</li> <li>Using available resources and support to achieve a balance between a focus on achieving the desired outcomes and minimising the potential harmful outcome.</li></ul> <h3 id="factors-to-consider-when-undertaking-a-clinical-risk-assessment"><a href="#factors-to-consider-when-undertaking-a-clinical-risk-assessment" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Factors to consider when undertaking a clinical risk assessment</h3> <h4 id="recency-of-risk-how-recent"><a href="#recency-of-risk-how-recent" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recency of risk (how recent)</h4> <p>Both previous and most recent incidents must be considered when assessing risk, the more recent the
