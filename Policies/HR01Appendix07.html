What if you are in the middle of traumatic times in your life and have had no sleep and then the Team Manager tells you that you need to write a report for a case review meeting by the end of your shift and the person you support spits at you for no reason? Might this be a time when you speak harshly, or you are tempted to walk out on the shift? We know this sort of things occurs in care services. How might the Team Manager have treated you better? What could you have done to help them treat you better? So, treating people well is also about taking time for each other and talking to them with respect and positivity.</p> <h3 id="leadership"><a href="#leadership" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Leadership:</h3> <p>Everyone can be a leader whatever their role is. Geese fly in formation and when the one at the front tires another takes over and lets the previous leader rest further back in the formation. Most dissatisfaction expressed by staff is that they never see their manager or the directors/leaders and do not know what direction the service is supposed to be going. We expect our leaders to be accessible, visible and actively involved in improving the services. We expect our leaders to have emotional intelligence and communicate effectively with everyone. The Senior Management team will be visible and communicate regularly and clearly about the vision, the values and the direction of the company and services.</p> <h3 id="keeping-safe"><a href="#keeping-safe" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Keeping safe:</h3> <p>Tideway Care will endeavour to carry out our duty to keep staff and the people we support safe. We will do this by ensuring our staff are well trained, have an alarm system to call for help if needed, are clear about our lone working procedures, work in safe environments, understand the triggers that may cause a person they support to become distress and potentially hit out, continuously listed and respond to feedback about safety in the workplace.</p> <h3 id="engagement-and-involvement"><a href="#engagement-and-involvement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Engagement and Involvement:</h3> <p>We recognise that all our staff are unique and therefore will have unique views, thoughts, talents and skills to bring to the improvement of what we do and how we achieve the results we are aiming for. We will have both informal and formal ways of engaging with our staff and involving them in decisions made about the services they work in. We will also check engagement every year through our annual staff engagement survey.</p> <h3 id="communication"><a href="#communication" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Communication:</h3> <p>The greatest skill of a thriving organisation is its ability to communicate effectively; this is not just about sending out lots of memos but using multiple media channels and ensuring feedback is received to check understanding. Our technology will support communication and provide timely responses and feedback.</p> <h3 id="progression"><a href="#progression" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Progression:</h3> <p>We believe that a career-oriented, valued employee must experience growth opportunities within Tideway Care for them to stay with us and they are just the sort of person we will want to retain. Our workforce strategy includes the development of career pathways for our staff and we will continue to invest in the training and development of our staff. We may encourage our staff to apply for internal roles that will result in a promotion for them and support them to achieve progression.</p> <h3 id="resources"><a href="#resources" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Resources:</h3> <p>Having the tools to deliver a service well is important to us and therefore our staff. For example; we expect our technology to support the work we do so we will invest in the right IT equipment to enable to use it to its optimum level. We understand the concept of a ‘false economy’ and will test out scenarios to decide whether certain resources are of value or not. Our biggest resource of course is our staff and so we will also ensure that we resource services well so that the team around the people we support can also support each other and work successfully together.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
