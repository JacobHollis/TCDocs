Good physical health can impact on how people feel about themselves, their abilities and confidence to achieve day to day tasks.  People with a learning disability / autism have a higher prevalence of physical health problems and may have additional physical health long-term conditions such as diabetes, epilepsy or hypertension, etc. We therefore need to be very alert to the possibility of a medical emergency or the need for supporting them to attend physical health care appointments and engagement with their treatment and care.</p> <p>In general, health life styles equate to more fulfilled lives and the national health promotion initiatives help us to consider the following health issues:</p> <ol><li>Nutrition – 5 A Day</li> <li>Exercise - Be Active</li> <li>Alcohol and Substance Misuse</li> <li>Smoking Cessation</li> <li>Sexual Health</li> <li>Suicide Prevention</li> <li>Skin Cancer – Slip Slap Slop</li> <li>Breast Feeding</li> <li>Sudden Infant Death</li></ol> <p>We will work with public health colleagues to promote healthy lifestyles and support people to make healthy lifestyle choices.

The support plans must be confirmed as appropriate by the Team Manager and all of the relevant Programme Staff will be coached in how to implement the support plan.</p> <h3 id="recording-vital-signs"><a href="#recording-vital-signs" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recording Vital Signs</h3> <p>If someone requires regular physical health monitoring, the following vital signs recorded can provide indicators of deterioration in health:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Heart rate</strong>: You will be coached in how to take a pulse and provided with lots of help to practice this skill before asked to do this for the people we support. The heart rate can also be shown from the use of a sport watch (like a Fitbit) or digital device (mobile app)  if the person wishes to use this way of monitoring.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Blood pressure</strong>: It is now possible to take a person’s blood pressure with an automated readout and new technologies are being trialled for a phone or tablet to read your vital signs just by changes in your skin colour. A basic cuff and meter (sphygmomanometer) and stethoscope can be bought for around £20, a wrist BP and pulse recorder can be about the same price. For the people we support we will look into the best way for recording blood pressure for them if it is required on a regular basis- e.g. at least once a day.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Respiratory rate</strong>: You will be coached and shown how to record respiratory rate and lots of help and practice before you are required to record respiratory rates. It is an important, non-invasive and quick way of identifying if someone is physically unwell.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Temperature</strong>: using a non-invasive thermometer can help ascertain if someone has a fever. In most cases a person may be complaining of sweats and shivers or a general fever. You can check whether they have a temperature out of usual range and respond depending on critical nature of the reading. See below on NEWS.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Skin Pallor</strong>: A non-invasive and easy check for physical ill health is to look at the person’s skin colour; if they look ‘ashen’, ‘pasty’, ‘white’, and any other words used to describe an unusual skin colour; there may be a physical health reason for the change in their usual skin colour as it indicates poor blood flow circulating the body.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>The following may be required for specific conditions:</strong></p> <ul><li><p><strong>Urine output</strong>: You may be asked to help with a fluid intake and output chart to see if there are any discrepancies in the normal range balance it may indicate physical ill health such as kidney problems. The normal range for 24-hour urine volume is 800 to 2000 millilitres per day (with a normal fluid intake of about 2 litres per day). If someone’s output is greater than their input then they may be experiencing dehydration or an indicator of hyperglycaemia - poor diabetes maintenance.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Level of consciousness</strong>: There are a number of ways this is detected, such as AVPU (Alert, responds to Voice, responds to Pain, Unresponsive). This quick and easy tool gives a clear guide on peoples’ level of consciousness; people are identified as being at risk if they respond only to pain or are unresponsive. This would equate to a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8-9 and therefore they would require an urgent review as their airway may be at risk.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Pulse oximetry</strong>: an observation of pulse oximetry can often be used to confirm practitioners’ clinical view. Pulse oximetry measure the saturation of oxygen in someone’s blood via a pulse oximeter which can be purchased easily for someone who requires this on a daily basis. Also known as O2 Sats.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="national-early-warning-signs-news"><a href="#national-early-warning-signs-news" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> National Early Warning Signs (NEWS)</h3> <p>The NEWS is a well validated track-and-trigger early warning score system that is used in the majority of UK hospitals to identify and respond to patients at risk of deteriorating. It is based on a simple scoring system in which a score is allocated to physiological measurements already undertaken when people present to, or are being monitored in health care settings. The National Quality Board strongly endorses the use of NEWS as the standardised system for the assessment of acute illness in adults and communication between healthcare practitioners.</p> <p>The following six simple physiological parameters are included in the scoring system:</p> <ol><li>Respiratory rate</li> <li>Oxygen saturations</li> <li>Temperature</li> <li>Systolic blood pressure</li> <li>Pulse rate</li> <li>Level of consciousness</li></ol> <p>A score is allocated to each physiological parameter, the magnitude of the score reflecting how extreme the parameter varies from the norm. This score is then aggregated, and uplifted for people requiring oxygen. These parameters are already routinely measured in hospitals and recorded on the observation charts.</p> <p>An elevated NEWS score does not provide a diagnosis; it helps identify a sick patient who requires urgent clinical review in a standardised way. It is simple and pragmatic. NEWS also allows healthcare professionals to communicate about deteriorating patients in a common language.</p> <p>Full details on NEWS and links to NEWS training resources and charts containing the recommended clinical thresholds and materials for use are available from the RCP website at the links below.</p> <h4 id="how-where-should-news-be-used-and-not-used"><a href="#how-where-should-news-be-used-and-not-used" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> How/where should NEWS be used and not used?</h4> <p>NEWS can be used in all adults aged 16 or over (except pregnant women) and across all healthcare settings. It is particularly useful when patients are transferred from one setting to another – to ensure there is a clear understanding of the patient’s clinical state, risk of deterioration and prognosis.</p> <p>NEWS was originally developed as a tool to detect deterioration in hospital. The score is most useful when repeated measurements are taken over time to detect deviation from an established baseline.</p> <p>Training and documents can be accessed here:</p> <p><a href="https://news.ocbmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://news.ocbmedia.com/<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p>For Support Teams that are supporting someone with high physical health needs we will fully train and coach them in the NEWS table below so they are clear about when to raise alerts to the relevant people. This will be individualised for each person as is necessary to ensure the measurements are relatable to their specific condition and physical health norms.</p> <p>The table below shows each physical health monitoring measurement in terms of what is the normal range and what falls outside of it. So for example a temperature on average will be for an adult will be between 36.1 and 38 as in the column headed as 0 score. The columns scoring 1 shows a range either slightly above or below the normal range and observation should be continued to check any changes. Then the columns scoring 2 show the range where action is required to check physical health issues and you may be advised to provide anti-inflammatory medication, place a cold flannel in the person’s forehead, etc If it is in the ranges in columns scoring 3 then emergency services should be called immediately.</p> <p><img src="/images/NewsScorev3.png" alt="NEWS Scoring System" title="NEWS Scoring System"></p> <h3 id="first-aid"><a href="#first-aid" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> First Aid</h3> <p>Tideway care recognise that working with the people we support you may encounter a whole range of physical health needs. Predominantly your role will be supporting people to access the appropriate health checks and interventions. However, we also know that people with a learning disability and autism may have high levels of physical health needs such as a long-term condition and attributable health risks. This can be exacerbated by the long-term use of psychotropic medication and can also be possible we will support someone who has a heart condition.
