Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care holds a duty to ensure that any data recorded, processed and stored as part of our operations is handled in a fair and legal manner.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	The purpose of this policy is to set out the principles of the relevant data protection regulations and help our staff to understand how to abide by those principles.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	Processing personal data is an inevitable part of conducting our business, but we should always ensure we act fairly and responsibly.</p> <h2 id="_2-definitions"><a href="#_2-definitions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Definitions</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	It is important to first understand which data can be categorised as personal data and what to look for when considering this question. The safest approach is to assume everything is personal data until you can completely satisfy yourself that it is not.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong> <strong>What is personal data?</strong> - Personal data is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. This means if anyone could look at the data and determine who that data is about then you should consider it as personal data and apply the principles set out in this policy to it. Personal data can take any form, it could be text in an email, a record on a database or even handwritten notes in a notebook.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong> <strong>Special Category Data (Sensitive Personal Data)</strong> - Special category data is personal data that the law considers to be more sensitive and required additional protection.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	Sensitive data is that which is about a person’s race, ethnic origin, politics, religion, genetics, trade union membership, biometrics, sex life, sexual orientation or their health. Of particular note to Tideway Care is that any data pertaining to the people we care for is very likely to include information about their health and therefore should always be treated as sensitive data.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	In practice when data is identified as sensitive you must not only have a legal basis for processing it but also satisfy one of the conditions for processing special category data. These are set out in section 7.</p> <p><strong>2.6</strong> <strong>Anonymised Data and Pseudonymised Data</strong> - The standard for identifiability of data is often misinterpreted and you should learn to properly assess whether data is truly anonymised before treating it as though it is not personal data.</p> <p><strong>2.7</strong>	Remember that data is personal data <strong>if anyone could identify the individual concerned</strong>. For example, this would include a person with access to other information that might be used in conjunction with your data to identify the individual.</p> <p><strong>2.8</strong>	The following are some examples of common mistakes made in attempts to anonymise data:</p> <ul><li>Using initials instead of full names</li> <li>Using just the person’s NHS number</li> <li>Using just the person’s unique number from a database</li> <li>Using a nickname instead of given names</li></ul> <p><strong>2.9</strong>	In all of these cases it would be possible to still identify the individual and therefore the data would still be considered personal data. Doing some of these things can be useful for helping to reduce privacy risks but they should not be used to process personal data that has no legal basis to be processed.</p> <p><strong>2.10</strong>	If you are unsure about whether some data is personal data or not, it is best to assume that <strong>it is personal data until you can completely satisfy yourself otherwise.</strong></p> <h2 id="_3-principles"><a href="#_3-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Principles</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	Staff should understand the underlying principles of the law and be able to use them to make good decisions. The GDPR sets out seven principles, it is important to understand all of these before working with any personal data:</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Principle</th> <th>What The Law Says; Data Should be...</th> <th>Whar this can mean in practice</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td><strong>Purpose Limitation</strong></td> <td>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals</td> <td>Before you process any personal data you should understand what your lawful basis for doing so is – see section 7</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Purpose Limitation</strong></td> <td>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes</td> <td>Once you understand the purpose for collecting or processing some data you should also understand exactly what you need to do with that data order to fulfil this purpose - Don’t collect, store or process more data than you don’t need, don’t use the data in additional ways</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Data Minimisation</strong></td> <td>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data minimisation’);</td> <td>Similarly, don’t collect more data than you need to fulfil your purposes.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Accuracy</strong></td> <td>accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay</td> <td>Take every practical step to ensure data you record is accurate, if you discover something is inaccurate make sure it gets corrected.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Storage Limitation</strong></td> <td>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals</td> <td>Don’t store data for longer than is necessary. In practice it can be difficult to identify exactly how long some records should be retained, but the principle to understand is that if we are to retain some information we should understand why we should continue to do so and our justification should be reasonable.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)</strong></td> <td>processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures</td> <td>The systems and processes involved in collecting these data should be secure. The company is responsible for providing secure ways of using data and staff are responsible for using them.</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Accountability</strong></td> <td>The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance</td> <td>Tideway care has responsibility to monitor its own compliance with these rules and to be able to demonstrate how it meets its requirements</td></tr></tbody></table> <h2 id="_4-lawful-basis-of-processing"><a href="#_4-lawful-basis-of-processing" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Lawful basis of processing</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	Once data has been identified as personal data we must understand fully what data we require, what we intend to do with it and what is our lawful basis for doing so.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong> <strong>Processing</strong> - In the context of these regulations processing means doing anything that involves or affects the personal data in question. Common tasks this can include are;</p> <ul><li>Adding a record to a database</li> <li>Sending an email</li> <li>Amending a document</li> <li>Producing a report</li> <li>Looking up an individual’s details on a database</li></ul> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	There are six possible lawful bases for processing;</p> <ul><li><strong>Consent</strong> - the individual has given clear consent for you to process their personal data for a specific purpose</li> <li><strong>Contract</strong> - the processing is necessary for a contract you have with the individual, or because they have asked you to take specific steps before entering into a contract</li> <li><strong>Legal Obligation</strong> - the processing is necessary for you to comply with the law (not including contractual obligations)</li> <li><strong>Vital Interests</strong> - the processing is necessary to protect someone’s life</li> <li><strong>Public Task</strong> - the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law</li> <li><strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> - the processing is necessary for your legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party unless there is a good reason to protect the individual’s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests</li></ul> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	Before we process any personal data, we should identify what our legal basis for doing so is. Before any new data processing tasks are commenced, staff should undertake a full assessment of the task. Note that in most cases data processing that is necessary for the delivery of publicly funded Health &amp; Social Care services is covered by ‘public tasks’ in the above list.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong>	In order to process data, we must have at least one lawful basis to do so <strong>AND</strong> the processing must be necessary. Always consider whether we need to process data and whether there are less intrusive ways to achieve the same result.</p> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	Sometimes it will not be clear which lawful basis applies to an individual requirement to process some data, in these cases these questions will help provide some context;</p> <ul><li>Who does the processing benefit?</li> <li>Would individuals expect this processing to take place?</li> <li>What is your relationship with the individual?</li> <li>Are you in a position of power over them?</li> <li>What is the impact of the processing on the individual?</li> <li>Are they vulnerable?</li> <li>Are some of the individuals concerned likely to object?</li> <li>Are you able to stop the processing at any time on request?</li></ul> <p><strong>4.7</strong> <strong>Special Category data conditions:</strong> - Where data is identified as special category data it must also satisfy additional criteria set out in article 9 of the GDPR. Special category data is defined as;</p> <ul><li>data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation</li></ul> <p><strong>4.8</strong>	Within Tideway Care all data relating to the people we support is likely to come under the umbrella of special category data as it may include data concerning that person’s health.</p> <p><strong>4.9</strong>	Where data relates to the provision care services the justification for the processing of those data is usually paragraph (h) as this covers the provision of health or social care systems and treatment and management services. It is important to still ensure that any data processing is necessary, proportionate and performed in the interests of providing a good service.</p> <h2 id="_5-individual-rights"><a href="#_5-individual-rights" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Individual rights</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	The GDPR provides rights for individuals about their data, these are set out in brief detail here. Many of these rights can be invoked by the individual by making a request to us, this can be done verbally or in writing. Where an individual makes a request about their data please refer to the detail in section 8.2 for guidance about how we should respond.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong> <strong>The right to be informed</strong> - People who we hold personal data about should know who we are and what we are doing with their data. We must inform people when we collect data about them and ensure they are aware of what will happen to their data and the legal basis for any such processing.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong> <strong>The right of access</strong> - Individuals should be able to access their personal data. In order to ensure we respect this right we must allow individuals to make ‘Subject Access Requests’ and respond to them in line with the guidance provided in section 4.10.</p> <p><strong>5.4</strong> <strong>The right to rectification</strong> - Individuals have the right to rectify data that is inaccurate or to have it completed if it is incomplete. This means if an individual points out an inaccuracy about their data to us, we have the responsibility to ensure our records are updated in a timely fashion. In some cases the application of this right can be complex. For example, where data relates to an opinion that is under dispute, the subject may feel it is inaccurate when it in fact we may require the data to remain as is. Where this sort of dispute arises, we should ensure we communicate clearly with the individual about our reasoning and annotate the disputed data to denote the details of the dispute.</p> <p><strong>5.5</strong> <strong>The right to erasure</strong> - Individuals have the right to have their personal data erased, this is also known as the right to be forgotten. This right is not absolute and only applies in certain circumstances, this will largely depend on the legal basis relied on to hold or process the data. For example, if our legal basis to hold an individual’s data is their consent and they withdraw their consent, we must comply with any request to erase their data. If an individual requests that we erase their data and we feel that we still have both the need for that data and a legal basis to continue holding or processing it, we should attempt to communicate our reasoning to the individual clearly and without delay.</p> <p><strong>5.6</strong> <strong>The right to restrict processing</strong> - An individual has the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data. When processing is restricted this means we may continue to store their data but may not use it. As with the right to erasure this right is not absolute and will depend on the legal basis we have to process the data in the first place. Where there is a dispute about continued processing of data we must ensure we communicate clearly and effectively with the individual to attempt to come to a mutual understanding about how to proceed.</p> <p><strong>5.7</strong> <strong>The right to data portability</strong> - Individuals have the right to obtain and re-use their personal data for their own purposes. This applies to data an individual has provided to us. Where this is applicable we should ensure individuals have a way to access their own data and use it as they see fit.</p> <p><strong>5.8</strong> <strong>The right to object</strong> - Individuals have the right to object to the processing of their data. Specifically, there is an absolute right to stop their data being used for direct marketing, in other cases we may be able to continue processing data as long as we can demonstrate we have a compelling reason to do so. Individuals can make objections verbally or in writing and we must ensure we respond appropriately within one month of an objection. In the case of any objections relating to direct marketing we must ensure these objections are properly noted and that the relevant data will not be processed in this way in future.</p> <p><strong>5.9</strong> <strong>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling</strong> - Automated decision making is defined as any decision made solely by automated means without any human involvement. There are specific provisions within the GDPR to protect individuals’ rights in cases where automated decision making and profiling are used. Where a processing activity is covered by these provisions we must ensure that we;</p> <ul><li>give individuals information about the processing;</li> <li>introduce simple ways for them to request human intervention or challenge a decision;</li> <li>carry out regular checks to make sure that your systems are working as intended.</li></ul> <p><strong>5.10</strong> <strong>Requests made by individuals about their data</strong> - Many of the rights above may be invoked by individuals making a request to us. This can be done verbally or in writing. Any member of staff can receive a subject access request, if you receive a request and are unsure of how to respond please contact the data protection officer at data@tidewaycare.com for guidance.  Individuals making a request are entitled to the following;</p> <ul><li>Confirmation that we hold or process their data and of our legal basis to do so</li> <li>A copy of any data to which they are the subject</li> <li>Other supplementary information such as details of who their data has been shared with, copies of privacy notices or policies and further information about their rights</li></ul> <p><strong>5.11</strong>	By rule, Tideway care must respond within 1 month, but will endeavour to respond as quickly as possible to all subject access requests.</p> <p><strong>5.12</strong>	Before responding to subject access requests, we must ensure we can confirm the identity of the individual making the request and ensure that data we send to them is transmitted securely.</p> <p><strong>5.13</strong>	In general individuals making subject access requests should not be charged a fee, however if a request is deemed to be manifestly unfounded or excessive we may charge a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request.</p> <h2 id="_6-organisational-arrangements-accountability"><a href="#_6-organisational-arrangements-accountability" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6.
