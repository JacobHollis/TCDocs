Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care will ensure that the people we support, their families and members of the public are aware of their right to make a complaint and their rights throughout the complaints management process.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	This policy aims to ensure that concerns and complaints are handled effectively and without delay, with the aim of providing a positive response to the complainant whilst being fair and open to all those involved. In addition to this, we welcome feedback from everyone we encounter; both the positives and negatives.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	We are committed to reviewing and investigating concerns and complaints raised and learning from feedback to make things better.</p> <h2 id="_2-principles"><a href="#_2-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Principles</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	All concerns and complaints will be taken seriously and the person raising the issues will be treated with respect and without prejudice.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	The person handling the complaints process will communicate with the person who raises it  throughout the process and endeavour to resolve the complaint at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	All information obtained through the course of complaint management will be treated in a confidential manner and in line with current Data Protection and Freedom of information legislation.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	All staff will participate and support the investigation of any complaint where requested and have attended the training provided to enable them to effectively implement this policy.  Guidance is also available to staff who are required to write witness statements under the Statement Writing Procedure for Incidents and Complaints.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	Any staff leading investigation of complaints will have undertaken the relevant training and work within the Tideway Care investigation guidance.</p> <p><strong>2.6</strong>	A complaint is a written or oral expression of dissatisfaction which has had an impact on an individual which requires an investigation and a formal response. It has often occurred in the past and therefore cannot be immediately remedied. A complaint will also formalise the issue and will, in most cases, be required in writing.</p> <p><strong>2.7</strong>	A concern is a written or oral expression of dissatisfaction, worry or uneasiness that can be generally resolved without the need for a formal investigation. If the concerns raised causes any level of alarm an investigation will be undertaken and treated in the same way as a complaint or escalated to a safeguarding or HR concern and treated in accordance with policy. The rule of thumb is that the concern that causes alarm would be one that you have an uneasiness about or is likely to result in potential or actual harm. Those concerns that you have tried to resolve but the person is still unsatisfied must be escalated. The outcomes of investigation will be reported and any learning actioned and monitored for impact.</p> <h2 id="_3-making-a-complaint"><a href="#_3-making-a-complaint" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Making a Complaint</h2> <p>3.1	A complaint can be made in a number of ways, including:</p> <ul><li>In person</li> <li>By telephone</li> <li>By letter</li> <li>By email</li></ul> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	A complaint can be made to any staff member, manager or director of Tideway Care who will respond to the complaint with an acknowledgement within 72 hours upon receipt.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	Complaints should be made as soon as practicable to allow us to effectively investigate and remedy the issue.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong>	Where a complaint is made more than 12 months after the issue coming to the attention of the complainant it may be impractical to investigate. Where this is the case we reserve the right to not subject it to a formal investigation process, in line with best practice guidelines. However, we value all feedback and will endeavour to waive this time limit if it still practical and possible to properly investigate the issue.</p> <h2 id="_4-staged-process"><a href="#_4-staged-process" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Staged Process</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	There are 4 stages to Tideway Care Complaints process as follows:</p> <ol><li><p><strong>Local Resolution:</strong> Verbal complaint resolved at point of contact</p></li> <li><p><strong>Informal Resolution:</strong> Written/Verbal complaint resolved through discussion</p></li> <li><p><strong>Formal investigation:</strong> Written complaint investigated and findings documented in a written report stating outcome i.e. Complaint Upheld/Partially upheld/Not Upheld</p></li> <li><p><strong>Independent Review:</strong> Complainant dissatisfied with outcome Tideway Care Investigation and outcome response. An external review is commissioned</p></li></ol> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	Tideway Care will make every effort to resolve verbal complaints at the point of contact. Where this is not possible Tideway Care will seek the consent of the complainant to resolve it through informal resolution. This will involve:</p> <ol><li><p>Clarifying the complaint</p></li> <li><p>Informing all parties of their right to be accompanied by a support person/an advocate or a third party to any meeting/s held in relation to the complaint</p></li> <li><p>Meeting/s with the complainant giving them an opportunity to give their version of events and to provide evidence/explanations to verify the complaint</p></li> <li><p>Meeting/s with other relevant parties giving them an opportunity to give their version of events and to provide evidence/explanations in relation to their actions</p></li> <li><p>Confirming the outcomes/agreement reached in any discussion with the participants</p></li> <li><p>Giving the complainant the opportunity to identify what they would like to happen as a result of making the complaint</p></li> <li><p>Managing the expectations of the complainant and being clear with complainant about what can and cannot be achieved through the investigation</p></li> <li><p>Determining the sequence of events leading to the complaint and the root causes of the complaint.</p></li> <li><p>Ensuring any conclusions about the complaint are based on a logical flow to the evidence supporting the complaint</p></li> <li><p>Affording the person concerned the opportunity to consider any adverse proposed findings or criticism and to make representations in relation to them</p></li></ol> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	Tideway Care may offer Mediation by a mutually agreed 3rd party to attempt informal resolution of the complaint. Both the complainant and those to whom the complaint relates must agree to using Mediation.</p> <p><strong>4.4</strong> Where a complaint cannot be resolved informally a service manager will, if appropriate, set up a formal Investigation into the complaint.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong>	The Operations Manager will determine the best person to undertake the investigation and they will follow the Investigations procedure (see <a href="/Policies/OP04Appendix01.html">appendix 1</a>)</p> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	When the investigation of the complaint is complete the Investigating Manager will produce a written report, which will include:</p> <ul><li>Description of the complaint</li> <li>Steps in the Investigation</li> <li>Background to the Complaint/Sequence of events</li> <li>Findings of the investigation i.e. the outcome of each element of the complaint and whether it is upheld/partially upheld or not upheld. Including an explanation of the judgement</li> <li>Recommendations which they consider appropriate</li> <li>Appendices as relevant e.g. Notes of Meetings, records etc</li></ul> <p><strong>4.7</strong>	The complainant and others involved in the complaint will be given an opportunity to respond to the investigation report before it is finalised.</p> <p><strong>4.8</strong>	If the complainant does not accept the findings in the Investigation Report, he/she may seek a review of the process used to manage the complaint by requesting an external review.</p> <p><strong>4.9</strong>	Tideway care will appoint an independent review of the complaint from a valid organisation such as the Health and safety executive (HSE) who may carry out a new investigation of the complaint or recommend that a local re-investigation of the complaint be carried out by another member of staff independent of the initial investigating manager. They will inform the Complainant of the outcome.</p> <p><strong>4.10</strong>	Where the complaint will be investigated, the investigation manager must endeavour to have the investigation concluded within 30 working days of it being acknowledged.</p> <p><strong>4.11</strong>	Where the investigation cannot be concluded within 30 working days then the Investigation Manager must communicate this to the complainant and the relevant service/staff member within 30 working days of acknowledging the complaint and give an indication of the time it will take to complete the investigation.</p> <p><strong>4.12</strong>	The Investigation Manager must always update the complainant and the relevant staff/service member every 10 working days as a minimum.</p> <h2 id="_5-malicious-vexatious-and-anonymous-complaints"><a href="#_5-malicious-vexatious-and-anonymous-complaints" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Malicious, vexatious and anonymous complaints</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	In some instances, we may get complaints that are deemed malicious (deliberately with the intention to wound) or vexatious (the person makes persistent complaints with no grounding and remains unsatisfied by responses). We will support these complainants to understand the reason for this approach and consider the ways in which we can help them. Whilst we will not continue to investigate the complaints; we will either support the person to get appropriate assistance or if their actions become criminal (e.g. threatening towards an individual or deliberate and targeted harassment of another person) report them to the police.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	Anonymous complaints can be a challenge to investigate as they are potentially malicious; especially when directed at a particular staff member. However; the substance of the complaint may be significant and require investigation. The Operations Director will determine the actions to be taken in these circumstances.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong>	If a complainant makes a complaint in confidence, the identity of the complainant will only be known to the investigating manager. However, in order to carry out a full and proper investigation of the complaint, the complainant will be encouraged to fully engage in the process.</p> <p><strong>5.4</strong>	All complainants have a right to appoint an advocate to assist them in making their complaint and to support them in any subsequent processes in the management of that complaint.</p> <p><strong>5.5</strong>	Tideway Care will support people who use the service who wish to make a complaint and who otherwise would find it difficult or impossible to make such a complaint themselves, to source appropriate advocacy services.</p> <h2 id="_6-responses-and-redress"><a href="#_6-responses-and-redress" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Responses and Redress</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	Responses and redress will be consistent and fair for both the complainant and those involved. A redress could include:</p> <ul><li>Apology</li> <li>An explanation</li> <li>Admission of fault</li> <li>Change of decision</li> <li>Correction of misleading or incorrect records</li> <li>Technical assistance</li> <li>Recommendation to make a change to a relevant policy or process.</li> <li>Involving the complainant in identifying the solution to any problems highlighted by their complaint</li></ul> <p><strong>6.2</strong>	Tideway Care is committed to learning from complaints and will view each complaint as an opportunity for improvement. Managers will monitor the complaints received in their area and ensure that complaints are discussed at staff meetings as appropriate for the purpose of learning and service improvement.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	The Senior Management team will monitor trends with regards to complaints and to review all complaints which are escalated for informal resolution or formal investigation with a view to informing quality and service improvements.</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <p><a href="/Policies/OP04Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - Complaints Process Flow Chart</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP04Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Guidance on Initial Fact Finding for Complaints</a></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/8/2018, 3:38:46 PM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
