Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	One of the Company’s core values is; always treating people how we would want to be treated ourselves. We are committed to promoting and maintaining the highest level of ethical standards in relation to all of our business activities as we would expect the companies we deal with and compete with to adhere to.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	We want to ensure our reputation for honest, ethical and lawful service provision is upheld and is of paramount importance. This policy supports our approach to a zero-tolerance policy towards bribery and corruption.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	This Policy sets out the steps all of us must take to prevent bribery and corruption in our services and partnership working through ensuring compliance with anti-bribery laws, rules and regulations.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>	Tideway Care is committed to creating and maintaining a rigorous and effective framework for dealing with any suspected instances of bribery or corruption.</p> <p><strong>1.5</strong>	The UK Bribery Act 2010 defines corruption offences very widely to include commercial bribery as well as bribery of public officials. These Guidelines provide more information about the standards required by this UK law, because these are the standards of conduct all employees of Tideway Care must adhere to.</p> <p>As a simple summary of the key provisions in the Act, you should follow these three principles:</p> <ul><li>Do not make payments to someone (or favour them in any other way) if you know that this will involve or encourage some misuse of their position</li> <li>Do not misuse your position in connection with payments (or other favours) for yourself or others</li> <li>Do not deliberately use advantages to try to influence public officials for business reasons</li></ul> <p>If you have any cause for concern about accepting monies/ gifts from an organisation or individual always check in advance with your line manager</p> <h2 id="_2-hospitality-and-gifts"><a href="#_2-hospitality-and-gifts" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Hospitality and Gifts</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong> <strong>Hospitality and Gifts (whether offered or accepted) – Fundamental Principles</strong></p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	These Guidelines apply to all gifts, hospitality and entertainment that you receive or offer during your work with Tideway Care or which are otherwise connected, directly or indirectly, to the Company's business dealings</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	The Guidelines apply whether a gift, entertainment or hospitality is paid for by someone personally or is reimbursed by a company. The Guidelines also introduce an approval process and reporting obligations for gifts, entertainment and hospitality over particular limits and in certain other cases.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	In most cases, reasonable ordinary levels of hospitality (and related expenditure) intended to foster cordial business relationships and promote Tideway Care’s image will be acceptable under these Guidelines and the law.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	This policy does not prohibit entertainment and hospitality (whether given or received) with third parties where it is normal and appropriate in a business relationship or context and where it is not provided:</p> <ul><li>with the intention of improperly influencing a person to obtain or retain business or a business advantage; or</li> <li>with the intention of rewarding a person for improperly providing business or a business advantage</li></ul> <p><strong>2.6</strong>	Key considerations are:</p> <ul><li>whether the expenditure was proportionate with regard to the recipient and their organisation;</li> <li>whether the scale of the expenditure fell within the confines of this policy, and if not, whether special permission for it had been sought at the appropriate level within the organisation;</li> <li>whether the expenditure had been recorded; and</li> <li>whether the recipient was entitled to receive the gift or hospitality under the law of the recipient’s country.</li></ul> <p>If in doubt, you should contact your line manager or any member of the SMT for guidance before offering or accepting entertainment and hospitality.</p> <h2 id="_3-corporate-hospitality"><a href="#_3-corporate-hospitality" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Corporate Hospitality</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	Entertainment and hospitality can include any attendance at social events, functions, or other occasions, business lunches and drinks, evening dinners, whether they include a business purpose or not and whether received or offered.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	Where no prior approval or reporting is required</p> <ul><li>Ordinary business meals with someone with whom the company does business in the private sector, you can claim up to £100 per person entertained and £250 in in total per quarter for the same person.</li> <li>Occasional attendance at sporting, theatre and other cultural events with someone with whom the company does business in the private sector, provided these do not exceed the above limits</li></ul> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	When you will need approval from Management and when reporting is required</p> <ul><li>Any hospitality or entertainment more than £100 per person entertained and more than £250 in in total per quarter for the same person.</li> <li>Any hospitality or entertainment where there is potential for a conflict of interests</li> <li>Any hospitality or entertainment where there is any risk that it might be misconstrued as improperly influencing. For example, in a scenario where hospitality is close in time to the award of a contract in a competitive context</li></ul> <p><strong>3.4</strong>	When it is not permitted</p> <ul><li>It is policy that hospitality or entertainment are not to be provided to public officials</li> <li>Hospitality that is related in time to some actual or anticipated business with the recipient, particularly in a competitive context</li> <li>There should be no add-ons to approved or permitted hospitality, such as inappropriate overnight accommodation, travel costs, or sundry or lavish expenses</li> <li>No hospitality should be accepted or offered if it could be perceived to be lavish or excessive or not in proportion to the recipient</li> <li>Any hospitality that contravenes any rules applying to the individual to whom the hospitality is offered (i.e. any policy that another organisation has in place) or any laws applying to that other person. Any such rules or laws must be complied with</li></ul> <h2 id="_4-gifts"><a href="#_4-gifts" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Gifts</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	Gifts include any token of appreciation and gratitude, gift vouchers, cash, physical gifts (e.g. a bottle of wine) or other items of value (e.g. sports tickets) – whether received or offered.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	Where no prior approval or reporting is required</p> <ul><li>Gifts of nominal value, such as Tideway Care stationery and promotional material</li> <li>Modest gifts of up to £100 per person to our business partners in the private sector where these are customary in normal business dealings (e.g. over Christmas period). If you have concerns that the gift may be misconstrued as improperly influencing the recipient, it should not be made</li> <li>Receipt of modest gifts of up to £100 per person from our business partners in the private sector where these are customary in normal business dealings (e.g. a low value token of appreciation received in the Christmas period). If you have any concerns that the gift is provided in an attempt to improperly influence the work we do as a company, it should be politely declined.</li></ul> <h2 id="_5-charitable-donations"><a href="#_5-charitable-donations" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Charitable Donations</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	Before any charitable donation is given on behalf of Tideway Care, prior authorisation must be obtained from a senior director. All donations of any kind must be transparent. It should be possible at all times for the person initiating the donation to justify the reasons for a donation and to be accountable for it.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	The following information must be obtained before making, promising or giving any donation and should be retained for the records:</p> <ul><li>Who is nominating the particular organisation and how has the relationship come about</li> <li>Details of the proposed recipient organisation</li> <li>The proposed amount of the donation</li> <li>The specific purpose of the donation</li></ul> <p>In any instance of charitable giving there must be an accurate receipt or letter of acknowledgement for any donation.</p> <p>All charitable donations should be recorded accurately in our financial records and accounts.</p> <p>Requests for charitable donations can sometimes mask corrupt activity. No charitable donations should be made if these could be construed as improperly influencing another party with whom Tideway Care has a business relationship. Should you have any ethical concerns about a proposed charitable donation, you should report this immediately to your line manager or a member of the SMT.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong>	In any instance of charitable giving there must be an accurate receipt or letter of acknowledgement for any donation.</p> <p><strong>5.4</strong>	All charitable donations should be recorded accurately in our financial records and accounts.</p> <p><strong>5.5</strong>	Requests for charitable donations can sometimes mask corrupt activity. No charitable donations should be made if these could be construed as improperly influencing another party with whom Tideway Care has a business relationship. Should you have any ethical concerns about a proposed charitable donation, you should report this immediately to your line manager or a member of the SMT.</p> <h2 id="_6-whistleblowing-and-reporting"><a href="#_6-whistleblowing-and-reporting" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Whistleblowing and Reporting</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	Supporting our 'zero-tolerance' policy towards anti-corruption means we expect all staff to take compliance in this area seriously and encourage others to do the same.</p> <ul><li>We encourage all staff to report any concerns about corruption that they encounter and make sure that suspicious behaviour does not go unchallenged.</li> <li>It is therefore important that if you suspect that any employee or others working on our behalf may have or is about to engage in any corrupt conduct, or if you are approached by any other person who attempts to persuade you to engage in any conduct described, then you should report it immediately.</li> <li>It is better to voice your concerns, however minor they seem, than stay silent and allow potential wrongdoing to go unchecked or not investigated properly.</li></ul> <p><strong>6.2</strong>	We will support anyone who raises concerns in good faith. This includes ensuring that no one in our organisation will suffer any detriment for refusing to accept or pay bribes, or if they report concerns they have about others' conduct.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	A deliberate failure to speak up when there was clear evidence of corruption by others can itself lead to disciplinary action. Failure to report concerns can result in prohibited activity damaging our business and may suggest we as a Company or individual members of staff have been complicit in this behaviour.</p> <p><strong>6.4</strong>	All members of staff should be assured that reporting of any concerns will be handled sensitively.
