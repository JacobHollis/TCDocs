Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	This document sets out Tideway Care’s approach to Safeguarding children and vulnerable adults and provides the legal and corporate responsibilities placed on its employees. Its key aim is to prevent and reduce the risk of significant harm to children and vulnerable adults from abuse or neglect.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	It promotes supporting people in the least restrictive manner so that they may maintain control and choices in their lives as far as is possible. It highlights the differences between maintaining safety, supporting and encouraging as opposed to coercion and oppression.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	The Care Act 2014 creates a new legal framework for how Local Authorities and other parts of the system should work together to protect adults at risk of abuse or neglect.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>	Making Safeguarding Personal is a national requirement for authorities to ensure there is:</p> <ul><li>A personalised approach that enables <strong>safeguarding</strong> to be done with, not to, people.</li> <li>Practice that focuses on achieving meaningful improvement to people's circumstances rather than just on 'investigation' and 'conclusion'</li> <li>An approach that utilises social work skills rather than just 'putting people through a process'</li></ul> <p><strong>1.5</strong>	We will prevent abuse through our close engagement with the people we support, monitoring of people we support. Where abuse is suspected or identified, we will always report the concern immediately to line managers and the relevant external agencies.</p> <p><strong>1.6</strong>	We will work with other agencies to guide and assist the people we support and employees through the process. We will learn from each report and improve our practices where we identify lessons learnt and will ensure there is a feedback loop for all people involved.</p> <h2 id="_2-safeguarding-of-children"><a href="#_2-safeguarding-of-children" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Safeguarding of Children</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	Local Authorities have specific duties under the Children Act 1989 in respect of children in need (Section 17) and children at risk of harm (Section 47). All those working with adults and children in health, social care and voluntary sector settings have a responsibility to safeguard children when they become aware of, or identify, a child at risk of harm.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	Whilst Tideway Care Adult services support people over the age of 18 years; the people we support may encounter children and young people who may be a relative or may be a member of the public. Our staff should therefore be mindful of child safeguarding policy and practice. They should follow Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB) procedures which are based on the Government Guidance Working Together to Safeguard Children 2015. See <a href="/Policies/OP01Appendix01.html">Appendix 1</a>.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	There is an expectation that health and social care professionals who come into contact with children, parents and carers in the course of their work are aware of their responsibilities to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and young people. Children identified as being placed at risk by the behaviour of their parents or carers should be referred by adult workers into Children’s Services. See <a href="/Policies/OP01Appendix01.html">Appendix 1</a>.</p> <h2 id="_3-tideway-care-safeguarding-principles"><a href="#_3-tideway-care-safeguarding-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Tideway Care Safeguarding Principles</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	Tideway Care’s POWER approach to safeguarding is aligned to government policy and practices and the principles of the Care Act 2014:. We believe that power is all too often abused and is something we want to engage as a force of good. A definition of the word power is; ‘the capacity or ability to direct or influence the behaviour of others or the course of events’.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">POWER is:</p> <p><strong>P</strong>revention<br> <strong>O</strong>rganisation<br> <strong>W</strong>ellbeing<br> <strong>E</strong>mpowerment<br> <strong>R</strong>elationships</p></div> <h3 id="_3-2prevention"><a href="#_3-2prevention" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.2</strong> <strong>Prevention</strong>:</h3> <p>All staff will be recruited following both competency and value-based processes and it is mandatory for us to ensure that our staff have an enhanced DBS check prior to starting work. We feel strongly that our staff have a positive working attitude and approach for working with the people we support.</p> <p>Tideway Care will carry out a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks (previously Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check) for all new employees and volunteers who will work with children or vulnerable adults unsupervised. The DBS checks will be renewed regularly and at least every 3 years.</p> <p>The recruiting managers are responsible for checking DBS status of potential employees, as part of the recruitment process and must make sure this has been received before the employee works with children or vulnerable adults unsupervised.</p> <p>All staff will have induction training in safeguarding policy, procedures and identification of harm or potential harm. This will include the procedures mandated by their local safeguarding teams to ensure awareness of expectations of reporting and working with the local safeguarding partnerships. (See <a href="/Policies/OP01Appendix01.html">Appendix 1</a> for locality policy and procedures).</p> <p>All other service-based training will be underpinned by safeguarding policy and good practice. Following this they will have an annual update and refresher workshop which will be case study and scenario based with a follow-up workbook to be signed off by their line manager.</p> <p>Taking early action to identify people at risk and to support them to protect themselves when they are at risk of, or experiencing, abuse, neglect or exploitation and finding ways of helping people manage risk and access mainstream services. For example:</p> <ul><li>Identifying vulnerability factors and potential risks in needs assessment</li> <li>Addressing these risks in the support planning process</li> <li>Support plans to reduce loneliness or isolation</li> <li>Personalised information and advice</li> <li>Facilitating access to advocacy</li> <li>Signposting people to the right services to help them
See <a href="/Policies/OP01Appendix02.html">Appendix 2</a>: For Information on types of abuse and what to look for to spot potential abuse</li></ul> <h3 id="_3-3organisation"><a href="#_3-3organisation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.3</strong> <strong>Organisation</strong>:</h3> <p>The Team Managers will have enhanced training in safeguarding adults and children and they will ensure safeguarding is included in staff appraisal, development planning and supervision to check safe practices. Tideway Care employees are expected to attend any Local Authority training made available.</p> <p>The Operations Director is the Safeguarding Lead for the organisation. The safeguarding lead will be trained to Level 4 Safeguarding and ultimate responsibility lies with the Managing Director.</p> <p>The organisation will review all safeguarding incidents monthly and report trends, concerns and lessons learnt to the Senior Management Team who will review and monitor progress on improvement plans.
The organisation sets out key responsibilities for people who encounter the people we support; including staff, professional and non-professional visitors, contractors and consultants. (See <a href="/Policies/OP01Appendix03.html">Appendix 3</a>)</p> <h3 id="_3-4wellbeing"><a href="#_3-4wellbeing" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.4</strong> <strong>Wellbeing</strong>:</h3> <p>The welfare of staff and the people we support is the top priority of Tideway Care. Tideway Care seeks to promote a culture of transparency, clarity and inclusivity. This means that everyone is welcome to scrutinise what we do and help us improve it when required.</p> <p>We understand that to achieve wellbeing, people need to feel safe in their workplace and their home environments; we will therefore ensure that we check that both staff and people we support feel safe in our satisfaction surveys and will act to ensure there is a positive response by providing:</p> <ol><li>Security of premises</li> <li>Lone Working policy and support – including staff alarm system</li> <li>On call management support out of hours as minimum 24/7</li> <li>Safe environments that allow for safe surveillance without impinging on privacy and dignity</li> <li>Robust HR policies and procedures including responses to bullying and harassment</li> <li>Robust Risk Assessment and Support Planning which details what to do in risk situations</li> <li>Clearly communicated and effective whistleblowing &amp; complaints procedures das</li></ol> <h3 id="_3-5empowerment"><a href="#_3-5empowerment" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.5</strong> <strong>Empowerment</strong>:</h3> <p>All the people we support will have accessible information about their rights and guidance on ways of raising any concerns.</p> <p>Where verbal communication is a challenge we will ensure that the people we care for are able to express their views and concerns, making communication aids available where necessary. Because the people we support commonly find learning new things a challenge we will always check for understanding and support them to find ways of remembering what they can do and how they can get help.</p> <p>We will always involve the people we support and their significant others in risk assessment and support planning. We will work hard to help them understand when there are any restrictions required to maintain the safety of themselves or others and be clear about when this is reviewed and by whom. We will discuss our concerns with the people we support from the outset and let them know if we need to report concerns to others.</p> <p>In line with the principle of ‘Making Safeguarding Personal’ in line with the Care Act 2014 we will identify the personal wishes and outcomes the people we support want to see with respect to a safeguarding referral. They will be encouraged to involved and helped to understand what is happening at every step of the process.</p> <p>People must be assumed to have capacity to make their own decisions and be given all practicable help before they are considered not to be able to make their own decisions. Where an adult is found to lack capacity to make a decision then any action taken, or any decision made for, or on their behalf, must be made in their best interests.</p> <p>Professionals and other staff have a responsibility to ensure they understand and always work in line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005.; this helps protect people from decisions being made for them. In all safeguarding activity due regard must be given to the Mental Capacity Act 2005. In all cases where a person has been assessed to lack capacity to make a decision, a best interest’s decision must be made. Even when a person is assessed as lacking capacity, they must still be encouraged to participate in the safeguarding process.</p> <h3 id="_3-6relationships"><a href="#_3-6relationships" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>3.6</strong> <strong>Relationships</strong>:</h3> <p>Tideway Care believes that positive relationships with everyone we work with are important to delivering a great service. This includes our staff, the people we support, their families and other services and agencies we work with.</p> <p>We will keep our core values at the centre of what we do and foster relationships which promote trust, respect and empathy.</p> <p>We will achieve this through positive and frequent communication via a range of different media and facilitate a unified approach to supporting people.</p> <p>We will clarify our and other’s accountabilities and responsibilities through informal and formal joint working processes and agreements.</p> <p>Tideway Care works in partnership with other agencies including local authority services and police and follows local authority inter-agency guidelines. We fully participate in Safeguarding panels and Serious Case Reviews. Local Authority Safeguarding Policies and Procedures take precedence where there is any doubt about a course of action. All colleagues are expected to be familiar with our own internal policy and procedure as well as the Local Authority policies and procedures. A list of all the Local Authorities we work with, their contact details and links to their policies and procedure can be found on Tideway Care’s staff SharePoint. Managers are expected to check awareness and understanding of these and complete the information/declaration in <a href="/Policies/OP01Appendix04.html">Appendix 4</a>.</p> <h2 id="_4-governance"><a href="#_4-governance" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Governance</h2> <h3 id="_4-1safeguarding-lead"><a href="#_4-1safeguarding-lead" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>4.1</strong> <strong>Safeguarding Lead</strong></h3> <p>Tideway Care provides a designated person in a senior management position who will act as the Lead Safeguarding Officer and point of contact regarding all safeguarding matters.</p> <p>Representation will be reviewed as required, and annually as minimum.  The Lead Safeguarding Officer is responsible for:</p> <ul><li>Being a single contact point for employees and external agencies on behalf of Tideway Care, ensuring representation at meetings</li> <li>Remaining up to date and informed of all regulatory and legislative requirements surrounding Safeguarding</li> <li>Ensuring that all documentation relating to Safeguarding is accurate</li> <li>Facilitating the sharing of best practice and continuous improvement in service delivery</li></ul> <h3 id="_4-2duty-of-candour"><a href="#_4-2duty-of-candour" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>4.2</strong> <strong>Duty of Candour</strong></h3> <p>The Duty of Candour requires all health and adult social care providers registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to be open with people when things go wrong. The regulations impose a specific and detailed duty on all providers where any harm to a service user from their care or treatment is above a certain harm threshold. The Duty of Candour is a legal requirement and CQC will be able to take enforcement action when it finds breaches. The Duty requires providers to offer an apology and state what further action the provider intends to take in this situation. In practice, this means that care providers are open and honest with the people we care for when things go wrong with their care and treatment.</p> <p>To meet the requirements Tideway Care must:</p> <ul><li>Make sure it has an open and honest culture across and at all levels within its organisation</li> <li>Tell the people we care for in a timely manner when particular incidents have occurred</li> <li>Provide in writing a truthful account of the incident and an explanation about the enquiries and investigations that we will carry out</li> <li>Supply the person concerned or their representative with the results of any further enquiries into the incident and to keep records of all correspondence and notifications in person</li> <li>Offer an apology in writing</li> <li>Provide reasonable support to the person after the incident</li></ul> <h3 id="_4-3recording-reporting"><a href="#_4-3recording-reporting" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>4.3</strong> <strong>Recording &amp; Reporting</strong></h3> <p>Tideway Care has a clear and open process for raising safeguarding concerns and incidents.
