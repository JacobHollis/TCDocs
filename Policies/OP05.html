Our model has been developed through the integration of a range of performance models used in business and the key co-production and person-centred approaches cited as best practice in the field of care and support delivery.</p> <h3 id="policy-outcome"><a href="#policy-outcome" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Policy Outcome</h3> <p>After reading this policy you will be able to:</p> <ul><li>Understand the importance of co-production and personalisation in the assessment, planning and review of our programmes</li> <li>Understand and utilise our documentation and data collection systems to help you understand the needs of the people we support and record essential information about their care and support</li> <li>Identify how our persona-centred Planning and PBS approaches are embedded in the programme and the relevant processes</li></ul> <h2 id="_1-introduction"><a href="#_1-introduction" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1. Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care actively promotes people being involved in their own lives and futures to be able to make choices and gain control over how they develop independence and connect to their communities.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	The recording of the process of assessment, support planning and review is a legal requirement for support providers and we must adhere to the statutory duties for maintaining confidentiality and the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	The process of assessment, programme development and review is supported by various toolkits, accessible formats, outcome monitoring and Person Centred Planning tools and supplemented by assistive technology that enables improved communication.</p> <h2 id="_2-principles"><a href="#_2-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Principles</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	The safety and wellbeing of the people we support is our priority and therefore where there are identified risks, the programme says how these will be managed and reviewed and relates back to the risk assessments. We clearly link the risk identified with the appropriate programme.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	The assessment, planning and delivery of their care, treatment and support is centred on the people we support as an individual and considers all aspects of their circumstances, and their immediate and longer-term needs. This includes ensuring we reflect their needs, preferences and diversity in a consultative way, involving the people we support, their family and other significant people.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	The assessment process is key to identifying people’s needs and their engagement in this process will ensure that they understand the programme and all their needs are addressed.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	The measurement of progress and success through outcome monitoring is supplemented by our Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) programme which utilises data and qualitative information to review progress and celebrate successes.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	Documentation must be written in positive language and in plain English without using medical jargon or abbreviations. It should be written in a way that could be easily understood by people without professional backgrounds in health or social care.</p> <p><strong>2.6</strong>	If required, we will include pictorial or video format content into the programme if that is helpful to the people we support. Interpreting programmes for people whose English language skills require assistance should be made available.</p> <p><strong>2.7</strong>	Some people may need support with communication and understanding and when they cannot tell us their views, we must try and involve their family members and work with advocates to ensure we have their critical view of our programmes. A Mental Capacity assessment and Best Interest plan must be in place.</p> <p><strong>2.8</strong>	All programme documentation is stored on our electronic programme delivery system in our services; these are personal and sensitive records of care and must be treated in accordance with information governance, confidentiality of information legislation and guidance. (See <a href="/Policies/G05.html">G05 – Data Protection</a> &amp; <a href="/Policies/G06.html">G06 – IT Security</a>).</p> <p><strong>2.9</strong>	The programme must be reviewed where there is a change in need or identified goals change over time.</p> <h2 id="_3-the-process"><a href="#_3-the-process" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. The process</h2> <p>3.1	The diagram below represents the process of assessment, programme development, implementation and review.</p> <p><img src="/images/GLOEProcessChart.png" alt="GLOE Process Chart" title="GLOE Process Chart"></p> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	The key to successful outcomes is involvement and engagement with the people we support. Each step of the process must be undertaken with this in mind and the desire to change perceptions and negative attributions that label the people we support challenging.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong> <strong>Assessment</strong> requires consideration of all aspects of a person’s personality, qualities, experiences, relationships, wants and needs. Our assessment processes are designed to focus on the person and not the labels that have been attributed to them.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong> <strong>Risk Assessment</strong> is a necessity in the delivery of care and support for vulnerable people; it identifies areas of concern and leads to establishing a management plan which seeks to reduce risk and or eliminate it fully. A positive risk management plan is where we understand a risk may be present but look to test out whether it still exists to enable a person to progress.</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong> <strong>Goal Identification</strong> is the process of finding out what the person wants to achieve in a given timescale and considers how it will reduce a care need. The use of Person-Centred Planning Tools and Outcome tools are used to assist in developing individual goals; staff should consider the coaching model GROW (Goals Reality Options Will), as a framework for developing goals.</p> <p><strong>3.6</strong> <strong>Programme Development</strong> is the process of bringing together identified areas of need, concerns, goals and aspirations and identifying how support should be provided.</p> <p><strong>3.7</strong> <strong>Coordination and Implementation</strong> is led by the Team Manager or Programme Coaches who will supervise the team of Programme Facilitators to support the person to achieve their goals. Programme Coaches also act as the team leader and conductor of support and have the largest role in developing the programme with the people we support. The Programme Facilitators are the people who work day to day with people implementing the programmes.</p> <p><strong>3.8</strong> <strong>Reviews</strong> can occur as frequently as required and should occur at least monthly. This is an opportunity for all stakeholders to be involved in feeding back on current progress, any barriers encountered and plans for the future. Staff should ensure that the person we support is as involved as possible in the review process.</p> <p><strong>3.9</strong> <strong>Reassessing Programmes</strong> - All content of programmes should be continuously monitored and updated/ re-planned to meet the needs and preferences of the person we support.</p> <h2 id="_4-assessment"><a href="#_4-assessment" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Assessment</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	The people we support are likely to have detailed assessments and information documented by other organisations and providers. The Tideway Care Assessment Form is designed to capture the here and now more than the past. Where there is a history of needs the assessor should request copies of historical documention and assessments.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	If we need more information from the referrer or current provider, we will always request it and escalate request to a more senior person in the referring organisation if we do not get the information we require.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	The initial assessment form is designed to collect information about the person and then detail current areas of need and concern. The assessment form provides a summary of all potential support areas and helps formulate the initial goals and care package development.</p> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	The assessment standard is to provide feedback from the assessment to the referrer within 48 hours and to send written confirmation of the decision outcome to the referrer within 5 working days.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong>	All initial assessments will be undertaken by the Team Manager or Programme Coach and/or the PBS Practitioner/Consultant who will agree whether the person’s needs can be met by the service they have been referred to. The assessment may take several hours and can be conducted across multiple visits. An assessment may include:</p> <ul><li>Face to face meetings with the person referred</li> <li>Meetings with the staff team that currently support the person</li> <li>Meetings with family carer if possible</li> <li>Scrutiny of documentation relating to their current needs and care/programme</li></ul> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	Additional meetings may need to be arranged to assist with engaging with the people we support in the initial stages of assessing and programme development. Where required, assistive technology should be used to aid communication.</p> <p><strong>4.7</strong>	Identified needs and goals will be captured in the initial proposed care package and will detail outcome measures and programme outline.</p> <p><strong>4.8</strong>	A risk screen will be undertaken to identify areas of safety needs and we will explore the person's current preferences and hopes for their future. We will also record any preferences they have about where they want to live and what sort of location and community.</p> <p><strong>4.9</strong>	Following the assessment, the proposed care package will be fed back to the referrer in the format of a Programme Proposal which will include Assessment Summary, Accommodation Needs, Objectives, Goals &amp; Lead Measures and Transition Plan where it is agreed the person’s needs can be met within our services. Where the person is not suitable, we will provide details of the assessment and suggested ways forward for the current care team.</p> <p><strong>4.10</strong> If the Care Manager agrees with the proposal and authorises commencement of the care and support programme we will undertake further work to understand the needs of the PWS and transition them into the proposed programme. This will include undertaking a One Page Profile for staff to be able to get a feel for the person and their preferences and strengths.</p> <p><strong>4.11</strong>	Our Positive Behaviour Support Programme Assessment may be part of the Transition Plan for people in hospital and can be carried out over the course of 5 – 15 days depending on the ability of the referred person to engage with the team and their individual needs. For people needing to come to our services in emergency situations; we will continue to work with them to achieve the Programme Assessment; which can include:</p> <ul><li>Deep dive records review</li> <li>Person Centred Planning / Wellbeing (review/meeting)</li> <li>Functional Behaviour Assessment / Analysis - Interviews, questionnaires &amp; observations</li> <li>Essentials for Living (essential 8 assessment)</li> <li>Diagnosis specific assessment</li> <li>Baseline measures</li></ul> <p><strong>4.12</strong>	For people referred who are not in hospital; additional specialist assessments can be undertaken as required and agreed by the commissioning manager and care/support teams. They may include:</p> <ul><li>Person-Centred Planning / Wellbeing goals</li> <li>Low arousal and rapport curriculum established</li> <li>Essentials for Living curriculum development</li> <li>Challenging Behaviour cycle and response hierarchy</li> <li>Specialist Risk assessments (See Risk Assessment and Risk Management Procedure)</li> <li>Periodic service review (programme governance)</li> <li>Transition proposal</li></ul> <h2 id="_5-transitioning-to-tideway-care"><a href="#_5-transitioning-to-tideway-care" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Transitioning to Tideway Care</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	For some people transitioning is a matter of urgency because their current circumstances are unhelpful and causing distress. For others, transitioning will require a longer period of time to help them engage with their new service, understand the planned changes ad prepare for them as much as is possible.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong> <strong>Information</strong> - Each person we support will receive information explaining what Tideway Care is about and what to expect from the support available. The information must be important to them and may include:</p> <ul><li>Where they will live</li> <li>The community</li> <li>The staff</li> <li>The things we will support them with</li> <li>How to guide</li></ul> <p><strong>5.3</strong> <strong>Behaviour Programme Development</strong> - Our Behaviour Programmes are an essential part of transition planning and starts to develop the programme development process when the person enters Tideway care services; they include consideration of:</p> <ul><li>Use of behavioural technology –
<ul><li>Individual Functional assessment as the basis of all interventions</li> <li>Multi-component interventions: including environmental change, antecedent - manipulation, teaching adaptive behaviours, use of reinforcement and reactive strategies</li> <li>Systematic use of data to inform and evaluate interventions Use of other evidence-based approaches</li></ul></li> <li>Based on specific values
<ul><li>Person-centred values and beliefs underlie PBS</li> <li>Non-aversive and respectful: interventions must be socially valid and comparable to those for non-disabled individuals</li> <li>Involvement of stakeholders: family and friends must inform the intervention process, agree strategies and evaluate effectiveness</li> <li>Contextual fit: interventions must make sense for the values, skills and resources of these stakeholders</li> <li>Ecological validity: involvement of ‘typical agents’ in implementing the intervention, i.e. family and ordinary support staff</li></ul></li> <li>Focus on quality of life
<ul><li>Primary goal of PBS, non-contingent and non-negotiable</li> <li>Long-term focus to achieve generalised and lasting changes</li> <li>Includes improved relationships, increased community integration, greater self-confidence, increased choice and a fuller range of opportunities</li></ul></li> <li>Commitment to systems change
<ul><li>A belief that meaningful and lasting change is only possible if organisations and systems around people are changed</li> <li>A good Behaviour Support Plan is not enough – organisational systems must be introduced to support this and ensure its implementation</li></ul></li> <li>In addition, we are committed to the support and development of staff evidenced by explicit wellbeing initiatives, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and the use of Behaviour Skills Training (BST).</li></ul> <p><strong>5.4</strong>	We are committed to providing the following Structured Model: Positive Behaviour Support Programme (PBSp) and we will integrate the following insights.</p> <ul><li>MCA / DoLS assessments and Best interest decisions for restrictive practices</li> <li>Risk Assessments related to Behaviour Support Plan</li> <li>Quality of Life baseline information</li> <li>Challenging Behaviours baseline information</li> <li>Restrictive Practice baseline information</li></ul> <p><strong>5.5</strong> <strong>Transition Planning</strong> - The Programme will also include the Transition Plan with timeframes and approaches for introducing the new service and staff team to the person we will be supporting and their family.</p> <p><strong>5.6</strong> <strong>Reviewing transition plans</strong> - Monthly practice workshop – with all relevant parties will be held to review the transition plan; this will include all elements of the Practice Workshop structure as described in section 10 of this policy.</p> <p><strong>5.7</strong> <strong>Consent to Share Information Form:</strong></p> <ul><li><p>All programmes should have a completed <a href="/documents/OP05Form01-Information-Sharing-Consent-Form.pdf">Information Sharing Consent Form</a> and this should be reviewed on a regular basis.</p></li> <li><p>This form is to clarify with the person that we will need to share information on a ‘needs to know’ basis but assure them that we will maintain their confidentiality at all times unless there is a concern which needs information to be shared.</p></li> <li><p>The form may need to be completed by a member of their family if they lack capacity to sign initially; this would need to be highlighted on their capacity assessment form.</p></li></ul> <p>If the person’s capacity changes and they can consent; this must be recorded and a new form should be prepared for them to sign.</p> <h2 id="_6-outcomes"><a href="#_6-outcomes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Outcomes</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	Tideway Care is an outcomes-focussed organisation. All programmes should be developed with outcomes in mind and include overarching programme objectives, Goals and Lead Measures. We will work closely with the people we support to tailor the objectives of their programme to their needs and preferences. We will ensure that the objectives and outcomes of programmes can be clearly communicated with the people we support.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong> <strong>Programme Objectives</strong> are high-level objectives that describe the overall reason for the programme. These objectives help to guide the development of the rest of the programme.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong> <strong>Goals</strong> describe what we and the person we support are currently working towards achieving. These will often be in support of the overarching programme objectives. Goals need to stretch and compel you to reach further than you initially want to; it is expected that people reach 80% of their goals or the original Goal set was not set high enough. If less than 80% is achieved, then maybe the Goal was too much of a stretch at this time; adjust and review. Goals should be set according to SMART criteria;</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">SMART Goal Setting Criteria</p> <p><strong>S</strong>pecific<br> <strong>M</strong>easurable<br> <strong>A</strong>chievable<br> <strong>R</strong>ealistic<br> <strong>T</strong>ime-bound</p></div> <p><strong>6.4</strong>	A Goal has a number of <strong>Lead Measures</strong>. These describe specific things we can measure each day to allow us to monitor progress towards the goal. Lead measures take the form of a Yes/No question about the day in question and results can be summarised in weekly/monthly reviews. Each measure can be linked to a Risk Area in the Risk Manager. Results for each lead measure can be recorded on a daily basis through the Journal application.</p> <p><strong>6.5</strong>	Staff should consider the <strong>GROW</strong> model when setting or reviewing outcomes.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">GROW Stands for:</p> <p><strong>G</strong>oals - What do you want to achieve/learn?<br> <strong>R</strong>eality - Where are you now?– what are your current strengths?<br> <strong>O</strong>ptions – What are the options for achieving your goal?<br> <strong>W</strong>ill – What will you do? – What’s your support plan?</p></div> <p><strong>6.6</strong>	Traditionally risk assessment and management plans are integrated into the programme; the way this model addresses this is as follows:</p> <ul><li><p>As part of objective setting exercise the person will be asked about their concerns and the Programme Coach or Team Manager will introduce any concerns they have from the assessment process</p></li> <li><p>They will ask the person to consider their history of risk incidents and details and consider the most important aspects of what helped in the situation and what support they would need to reduce the risk of re-occurrence</p></li> <li><p>Concerns may be related to physical health – e.g. I have high blood pressure or familial – e.g. my partner has a history of violence or mental health – e.g. I am anxious about living on my own and I might cut my wrists when anxious</p></li></ul> <p><strong>6.7</strong>	We will use the person’s own words for what they think their need is and clarify by adding the staff views if this differs or is helpful to clarify the need. Staff should be wary of making goals which are overly broad or generic to cover all bases, this can leave the care of delivery vague and unfocused.</p> <p><strong>6.8</strong> Some People We Support may have higher personal care and physical health support needs and therefore may have standard operating procedures to help guide staff sequentially through how best to support a specific condition, a procedure or a standard approach for behaviours.</p> <h2 id="_7-programme-delivery"><a href="#_7-programme-delivery" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7. Programme delivery</h2> <p><strong>7.1</strong> <strong>Daily Records</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Daily records entries are made on the Tideway Programme Journal. On the journal staff can access information such as the person’s one page profile, standard operating procedures, Objectives and goals</li> <li>Each goal will have lead measures that the staff can log as achieved or not achieved each day and provide any additional comments as appropriate. Staff can also log diary notes as they go along, positive events and incidents. Each entry is dated, timed and allocated to the person who logs the information</li> <li>Staff should encourage the person we support to be actively involved in their entries and reviews about their programme</li></ul> <p><strong>7.2</strong> <strong>Co-Production and Person-Centred Planning</strong> - The principles and processes that underpin Co-Production and Person Centred Planning are embedded in the way we approach Programme Development. Always seeking the involvement of the PWS and their families to help them lead the care and support programme development as far as is possible.</p> <p><strong>7.3</strong> There are many Person-Centred Planning (PCP) tools available to assist us in getting to know the people we support, highlighting their strengths and assets, helping them establish where they want to get to and what a great life looks like. We have resources and training in place to support our staff to utilise these tools. Examples are described in <a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix06.html">Appendix 6</a></p> <p><strong>7.4</strong>	Whilst we will use many of the tools referred to above and the frameworks mentioned; it is our intention to have one programme that is meaningful and achievable for the person and the staff team that supports them.  All the information collated in using these tools will be kept on the person’s programme records for reference.</p> <p><strong>7.5</strong>	The programmes will be available both in written form to assist governance and regulation purposes but also in a media that is accessible for the people we support and their families.</p> <p><strong>7.6</strong>	These programmes will support the staff to facilitate and deliver support / tasks; and will clearly define expectations for continuous monitoring and review to check how well we are doing.</p> <p><strong>7.7</strong>	Support to increase community engagement will form part of the programme and include activities traditionally known as housing related support. Practical tasks and activities will be identified needs and staff will coach the people we support to increase their daily living and interpersonal skills, relationships with others, knowledge of community opportunities for managing their home, leisure activity, education and work opportunities, etc.</p> <p><strong>7.8</strong>	Community engagement activities will also include:</p> <ul><li>Community awareness raising events</li> <li>Invitations for community to learn more about what we do and how they can help support people with a learning disability and or autism</li> <li>Working with community services to learn about helpful approaches to identifying risk and vulnerability in the people we support and how best to respond</li> <li>Helping community services make adjustments to their services that stop excluding people with a learning disability and or autism</li></ul> <p><strong>7.9</strong>	Tideway Care will seek partnerships with as many community services as is possible and will work with service level agreements (SLAs) to clarify how the relationship can work in practice. Specific SLAs will be agreed with housing providers to establish responsibilities of landlord and tenant</p> <h2 id="_8-review-and-feedback"><a href="#_8-review-and-feedback" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 8. Review and feedback</h2> <p><strong>8.1</strong> <strong>Weekly/ Monthly Review</strong>: We will hold a weekly/ monthly team review (dependant on need) which will focus on the previous week/month and plan for the subsequent one. People are more accountable for their actions when they express to others what it is they are going to do. These meetings can be brief and succinct or allow for more conversation and discussion; it’s up to you / the team. What works for you /the team? A discussion with each person stating:</p> <ul><li>What did I say I would do?</li> <li>What did I do?</li> <li>What am I going to do next?</li></ul> <p>In these meetings we look at the measures (lead measures) that if achieved will lead to a metric that shows progress or deterioration over a period of time (lag measure)</p> <p><strong>8.2</strong> <strong>Practice Workshops</strong>: where someone has significant behaviours that challenge these are held monthly and led by the PBS Practitioner / Consultant. The workshops will include input from as many of the following as possible:</p> <ul><li>The person we are supporting</li> <li>A family representative</li> <li>The Programme Coach/ Team Manager</li> <li>Programme Facilitators</li> <li>Any other significant persons</li></ul> <p>The workshops include a review of data collected about activities participated in, incidents, issues emerged, support plan implementation, etc.</p> <p><strong>8.3</strong> <strong>Care Manager reviews</strong>: The people we support should have regular formal review with the wider circle of support and significant professionals to ensure we have a joint understanding of progress, barriers to progress and agreement about next steps. The meeting will be led by the person's Care Manager.</p> <p><strong>8.4</strong> <strong>Feedback</strong>:</p> <ul><li><p>It is important that we receive feedback both positive and negative from the people we support so that we can learn about what has a good and poor impact on them. This will help shape service development and ensure that our customer satisfaction is at the forefront of what we do</p></li> <li><p>We encourage continuous feedback and regular communication with all family members and stakeholders involved with supporting the PWS. We aim to be accessible and responsive at all times</p></li> <li><p>People we support and their families should always be encouraged to tell us if they are happy or unhappy with their staff team and support</p></li> <li><p>Reviews should contain a summary of all feedback and any views expressed by the person we support, their family or any other stakeholders during the week/month in question</p></li></ul> <h2 id="_9-advanced-directives"><a href="#_9-advanced-directives" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 9. Advanced directives</h2> <p><strong>9.1</strong>	For the purpose of these guidelines, the term advanced directives refers to any plan that details a person’s preferences for treatment and care in the context of potential future needs or wishes to be fulfilled in a given circumstance such as end of life.</p> <p><strong>9.2</strong>	An advance directive may be identified and represented in the form of a person’s Person-Centred Plan and or their programme.</p> <p><strong>9.3</strong>	There are many resources to assist the people we support to identify preferences, interests, collaborative risk assessment and management tools and recovery goal setting tools available.  These can help assist the people we support to identify their advanced directives.</p> <p><strong>9.4</strong>	The people we support may have long term high risk physical health issues and may wish to make an advanced directive in relation to this.</p> <h2 id="_10-transitioning-from-tideway-care"><a href="#_10-transitioning-from-tideway-care" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 10. Transitioning from Tideway Care</h2> <p><strong>10.1</strong>	Transition planning is part of a continuum of support we provide; from the first assessment through to participation in the Tideway Care Programme and follow-up support the person being supported is transferring to their next service provider.</p> <p><strong>10.2</strong>	A comprehensive transition plan should be developed before transfer, including links made with other agencies as relevant to the identified needs:</p> <ul><li>Provision of clear and accessible information and education to the person being supported, and their family if appropriate, about the new service provider and the transfer process is essential.</li> <li>Sharing of information such as their current Support Plan and Behaviour Support Plan will be necessary for the new provider to be able to continue to support the person.</li> <li>Phased exposure to the new provider and care and support team will be timed at a pace to suit the person we support to minimise distress as much as possible.</li> <li>Discussing transitioning from the offset of the programme will be embedded in our processes.</li></ul> <p><strong>10.3</strong>	Tideway Care will continue to in-reach into the new provider services for a period of up to 8 weeks post leaving our Tideway Care accommodation and will plan a phased withdrawal with the person transitioning.</p> <p><strong>10.4</strong>	Tideway Care will support the new provider with training sessions for staff where it is deemed helpful by the commissioners.</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - Risk Assessment and Management Procedures</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Risk Assessment and Management Guidance</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix03.html">Appendix 3 - Reducing Self Harm Guidelines</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix04.html">Appendix 4 - Substance Misuse Guidance</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix05.html">Appendix 5 - Information Sharing Consent Form</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix06.html">Appendix 6 - Co-Production and Person-Centred Planning</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix07.html">Appendix 7 - Sex and Sexuality Guidelines</a></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">7/12/2019, 10:33:32 AM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
