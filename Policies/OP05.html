Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care actively promotes people being involved in their own lives and future to be able to make choices and gain control over how they develop independence and connect to their communities.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	The recording of the process of assessment, support planning and review is a legal requirement for support providers and we must adhere to the statutory duties for maintaining confidentiality and the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	The process of assessment, programme development and review is supported by various toolkits, accessible formats, outcome monitoring and Person Centred Planning tools and supplemented by assistive technology that enables improved communication.</p> <h2 id="_2-principles"><a href="#_2-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Principles</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	The safety and wellbeing of the people we support is our priority and therefore where there are identified risks, the programme says how these will be managed and reviewed and relates back to the risk assessments. We clearly link the risk identified with the appropriate programme.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	The assessment, planning and delivery of their care, treatment and support is centred on the people we support as an individual and considers all aspects of their circumstances, and their immediate and longer-term needs. This includes ensuring we reflect their needs, preferences and diversity in a consultative way, involving the people we support, their family and other significant people.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	The assessment process is key to identifying people’s needs and their engagement in this process will ensure that they understand the programme and all their needs are addressed.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	The measurement of progress and success through outcome monitoring is supplemented by our Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) programme which utilises data and qualitative information to review progress and celebrate successes.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	Documentation must be written in positive language and in plain English without using medical jargon, abbreviations. It should be written in a way that could be easily understood by people without professional backgrounds in health or social care.</p> <p><strong>2.6</strong>	If required, we will include pictorial or video format content into the programme if that is helpful to the people we support. Interpreting programmes for people whose English language skills require assistance should be made available.</p> <p><strong>2.7</strong>	Some people may need support with communication and understanding and so sometimes when they cannot tell us their views, we must try and involve their family members and work with advocates to ensure we have their critical view of our programmes. A Mental Capacity assessment and Best Interest plan must be in place.</p> <p><strong>2.8</strong>	All programme documentation is stored on our electronic programme delivery system in our services; these are personal and sensitive records of care and must be treated in accordance with information governance, confidentiality of information legislation and guidance as per the new GDPR (See <a href="/Policies/G05.html">G05 – Data Protection</a> &amp; <a href="/Policies/G06.html">G06 – IT Security</a>).</p> <p><strong>2.9</strong>	The programme must be reviewed where there is a change in need or identified goals change over time.</p> <h2 id="_3-the-process"><a href="#_3-the-process" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. The process</h2> <p>3.1	The diagram below represents the process of assessment, programme development, implementation and review.</p> <p><img src="/images/GLOEProcessChart.png" alt="GLOE Process Chart" title="GLOE Process Chart"></p> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	The key to successful outcomes is involvement and engagement with the people with support. Each step of the process must be undertaken with this in mind and the desire to change perceptions and negative attributions that label the people we support challenging.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong> <strong>Assessment</strong> requires consideration of all aspects of a person’s personality, qualities, experiences, relationships, wants and needs. Our assessment processes are designed to focus on the person and not the labels that have been attributed to them.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong> <strong>Risk Assessment</strong> is a necessity in the delivery of care and support for vulnerable people; it identifies areas of concern and leads to establishing a management plan which seeks to reduce risk and or eliminate it fully. A positive risk management plan is where we understand a risk may be present but look to test our whether it still exists to enable a person to progress.</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong> <strong>Goal Identification</strong> is the process of finding out what the person wants to achieve in a given timescale and considers how it will reduce a care need. The use of Person Centred Planning Tools and Outcome tools are used to assist in developing individual goals; we have adapted the coaching model GROW (Goals Reality Options Will), as our framework for developing goals.</p> <p><strong>3.6</strong> <strong>Programme Development</strong> is the process of bringing together identified areas of need, concerns, goals and aspirations and identifying how support should be provided.</p> <p><strong>3.7</strong> <strong>Coordination and Implementation</strong> is led by the Programme Coaches who will supervise the team of Programme Facilitators to support the person to achieve their goals. Programme Coaches also act as the team leader and conductor of support and have the largest role in developing the programme with the people we support. The Programme Facilitators are the people who work day to day with people implementing the programmes.</p> <p><strong>3.8</strong> <strong>Reviews</strong> can occur as frequently as the people we support have agreed with us; a daily review of how the day has gone is encouraged but for some this may seem too much. Review of the previous week will be undertaken at the weekly accountability meetings and formal and comprehensive review will occur at the monthly practice workshops led by the PBS Practitioner or PBS Consultant.  The PBS Practitioner and PBS Consultant are very experienced and qualified people who have worked positively with people who have behaviours that challenge and are responsible for developing behavioural aspects of the programme, supporting staff to deliver them and creating time for exploration of the meaning of behaviours, the impact of environments, the values we work with and celebrating successes.</p> <p><strong>3.9</strong> <strong>Reassessing Goals</strong> and Programmes will occur as and when things change and the people we support agree they need to be revisited. All measures will be monitored daily and in weekly review meetings led by the Programme Coach and or Team Manager. All measures and goals will be reviewed at the monthly Practice Workshops as a minimum. However, the measures and goals may change over time in light of achieving goals or any changes.</p> <h2 id="_4-assessment"><a href="#_4-assessment" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Assessment</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	The people we support are likely to have detailed assessments and information documented by other organisations and providers. The Tideway Care Assessment Form is designed to capture the here and now more than the past. It is expected that where there is a history of needs this is well documented and has been shared with us.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	If you need more information from the referrer or current provider, always request it and escalate request to a more senior person in the referring organisation if you do not get the information you require.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	The initial assessment form is designed to collect personal information and demographics and then detail current areas of need and concern. The assessment form provides a summary of all potential support areas and helps formulate the initial goals and care package development.</p> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	The assessment standard is to provide feedback from the assessment to the referrer within 48 hours and to send written confirmation of the decision outcome to the referrer within 5 working days.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong>	All initial assessments will be undertaken by the Programme Coach and/or the PBS Practitioner/Consultant who will agree whether the person’s needs can be met by the service they have been referred to. The assessment may take several hours and visits and include face to face meeting with the person referred, time with the staff team that currently support them, time with family carer if possible and scrutiny of documentation relating to their current needs and care/programme.</p> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	Additional meetings may need to be arranged to assist with engaging with the people we support in the initial stages of assessing and programme development. We use Person Centred tools and digital media to capture preferences and enable participation for the people we support who have poor or no literacy skills.</p> <p><strong>4.7</strong>	Identified needs and goals will be captured in the initial proposed care package and will detail outcome measures and programme outline.</p> <p><strong>4.8</strong>	Following the assessment, the proposed care package will be fed back to the referrer in the format of a Referral Response, Assessment Summary and Transition Plan where it is agreed the person’s needs can be met within our services. Where the person is not suitable we will provide details of the assessment and suggested ways forward for the current care team.</p> <p><strong>4.9</strong>	Our Positive Behaviour Support Programme Assessment will be part of the Transition Plan for people in hospital and can be carried out over the course of 5 – 15 days depending on the ability of the referred person to engage with the team. For people needing to come to our services in emergency situations; we will continue to work with them to achieve the Programme Assessment; which can include:</p> <ul><li>Deep dive records review</li> <li>Person Centred Planning / Wellbeing (review/meeting)</li> <li>Functional Behaviour Assessment / Analysis - Interviews, questionnaires &amp; observations</li> <li>Essentials for Living (essential 8 assessment)</li> <li>Diagnosis specific assessment</li> <li>Baseline measures</li></ul> <p><strong>4.10</strong>	For people referred who are not in hospital; additional specialist assessments can be undertaken as required and agreed by the commissioning manager and Care/support teams. They may include:</p> <ul><li>PCP / Wellbeing goals</li> <li>Low arousal and rapport curriculum established</li> <li>Essentials for Living curriculum development</li> <li>CB cycle and response hierarchy</li> <li>Risk assessments (See Risk Assessment and Risk Management Procedure)</li> <li>Periodic service review (programme governance)</li> <li>Staff training development (BST)</li> <li>Transition proposal</li></ul> <h2 id="_5-transitioning-to-tideway-care"><a href="#_5-transitioning-to-tideway-care" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Transitioning to Tideway Care</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	For some people transitioning is a matter of urgency because their current circumstances are unhelpful and causing distress. For others, transitioning will require a longer period of time to help them engage with their new service, understand the planned changes ad prepare for them as much as is possible.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong> <strong>Information Leaflets</strong> - Each service will have a service information leaflet or video which is useful for explaining what the service is about and what to expect from the support available in the service. The information must be important to them and may include:</p> <ul><li>Where they will live</li> <li>The community</li> <li>The staff</li> <li>The things we will support them with</li> <li>How to guide</li></ul> <p><strong>5.3</strong> <strong>Behaviour Programme Development</strong> - Our Behaviour Programmes are an essential part of transition planning and starts to develop the programme development process when the person enters Tideway care services; they include consideration of:</p> <ul><li>Use of behavioural technology –

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Programme development</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	The OKRs help determine the areas of focus for the individual to find the overriding objectives of their programme with us and the Key Result Areas they want to work on.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong>	OKRs consist of a list of 3-5 high-level objectives. Under each objective then usually 3-5 key measurable results are listed. Each key result may have a progress indicator or score of 0-100% or 0 to 1.0 that shows its achievement.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	OKRs need to stretch and compel you to reach further than you initially want to; it is expected that people reach 80% of their goals or the original OKR set was not set high enough. If less than 80% is achieved then maybe the OKR was too much of a stretch at this time; adjust and review.</p> <p><strong>6.4</strong>	The Programme Coach will work with the person to identify their OKRs and represent them in pictorial or video form if helpful. The Wheel of Success is one way of showing the OKRs and measuring success.</p> <p><strong>6.5</strong>	The next stage will be to use the <strong>GROW</strong> model to check the OKRs and develop the programme.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">GROW Stands for:</p> <p><strong>G</strong>oals<br> <strong>R</strong>eality<br> <strong>O</strong>ptions<br> <strong>W</strong>ill</p></div> <p><strong>6.6</strong>	The goals will be the identified key results developed from the OKRs; it is important to spend time on developing your goals and checking how the person can be supported to achieve them to inform the support plan.</p> <p><strong>6.7</strong>	Traditionally risk assessment and management plans are integrated into programme; the way this model addresses this is as follows:</p> <ul><li><p>As part of the OKR exercise the person will be asked about their concerns and the PRC will introduce any concerns they have from the assessment process.</p></li> <li><p>They will ask the person to consider their history of risk incidents and details and consider the most important aspects of what helped in the situation and what support they would need to reduce the risk of re-occurrence.</p></li> <li><p>Concerns may be related to physical health – e.g. I have high blood pressure or familial – e.g. my partner has a history of violence or mental health – e.g. I am anxious about living on my own and I might cut my wrists when anxious</p></li> <li><p>If the person has a recovery wellbeing or crisis contingency plan that has been jointly developed with the care coordinator you will need to link to their Behaviour Support plan and check that actions are consistent.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>6.8</strong>	Remember: Use the person’s own words for what they think their need is and clarify by adding the staff views if this differs or is helpful to clarify the need. Many staff fall into the trap of making goals broader and more generic to cover all bases, but this leaves the care delivery vague and unfocussed therefore goals and interventions must use SMART criteria.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">SMART Goal Setting Criteria</p> <p><strong>S</strong>pecific<br> <strong>M</strong>easurable<br> <strong>A</strong>chievable<br> <strong>R</strong>ealistic<br> <strong>T</strong>ime-bound</p></div> <h2 id="_7-programme-delivery"><a href="#_7-programme-delivery" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7. Programme delivery</h2> <p><strong>7.1</strong> <strong>Daily Records</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Daily records entries are for any documentation of support sessions, recording of information shared, reports on incidents and safeguarding notifications, etc.</li> <li>PRC sessions should be held at time intervals led and agreed with the customer to check progress on programme.</li> <li>Encourage the person we support to sign off the entries and reviews so that they are involved at every point.</li></ul> <p><strong>7.2</strong> <strong>Person Centred Planning</strong> - There are many Person-Centred Planning (PCP) tools available to assist us in getting to know the people we support, highlighting the strengths and assets, helping them establish where they want to get to and what a great life looks like. We have resources and training in place to support our staff to utilise these tools. Examples are:</p> <ul><li><p>One Page Profile:</p> <ul><li>When a customer enters our service, we want to get to know them and therefore completing the one-page profile is a good way to get to know a bit about them.</li> <li>If they do not have good communication skills you can ask family members to help or get them to pick out pictures that mean something to them.</li></ul></li> <li><p>Circles of Support:</p> <ul><li>We seek to develop circles of support with the people we support; ensuring they lead this process as far as is possible. Circles of support are a network people who are willing to support someone to achieve their goals.</li></ul></li> <li><p>Path:</p> <ul><li>The path process can take many hours, even days to formulate depending on how easily the person we support can engage in the process. It may be that the development of the Path documentation /audio / video will assist with defining someone’s objectives, key result areas and goals.</li></ul></li> <li><p>Health passports:</p> <ul><li>For people with high levels of healthcare needs or for those who don’t have high levels of need but want to access healthcare without feeling anxious of distressed; we complete health passports which detail:
<ul><li>The areas of health need</li> <li>How the person wants to be involved in their healthcare</li> <li>Medication</li> <li>Communication aids</li> <li>Preferences</li> <li>Etc</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>7.3</strong>	The PBS Practitioner and Programme Coach will work together to deliver Behaviour Skills Training (BST) in 1-1 sessions with the people we support. Dr Miltenberger defines BST as “a procedure consisting of instruction, modelling, behavioural rehearsal, and feedback that is used to teach new behaviours or skills” (2004, p. 558). And that’s exactly what it is, a 4-step teaching strategy that works!”</p> <p><img src="/images/BSTFlowchart.png" alt="BST Flowchart" title="BST Flowchart"></p> <p><strong>7.4</strong>	BST teaches a person what to do — that is, what behaviours to engage in under a circumstance.  It allows for practice within the program so that the person can become fluent with the skills.  It is an effective train-the-trainer procedure. And perhaps most importantly, can be individualized to each person. These are the stages</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Instruction</strong> – Provide a description of the skill, its importance or rationale, and when and when not to use the skill. Repeat this step as necessary.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Modelling</strong> – Show your participant how to perform the skill. In-vivo modelling is recommended.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Rehearsal</strong> – Practice, practice, and practice! Allow the participant opportunities to practice the skill. Recent research suggests that participants should be able to practice in-situ. The trainer should record data on correct and incorrect responding during this step.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Feedback</strong> – The trainer should provide positive praise for correct responding and some form of corrective feedback for incorrect responses.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>7.5</strong>	Some requirements before you can implement a BST program include: the person receiving the training must have the pre-requisite skills required for the behaviours you are teaching, the skill must include a chain of behaviours (a number of skills), and you must be able to role-play or video model the skills.</p> <p><strong>7.6</strong>	Whilst we will use many of the tools referred to above and the frameworks mentioned; it is our intention to have one programme that is meaningful and achievable for the person and the staff team that supports them.  All the information collated in using these tools will be kept on the person’s programme records for reference.</p> <p><strong>7.7</strong>	The programmes will be available both in written form to assist governance and regulation purposes but also in a media that is accessible for the people we support and their families.</p> <p><strong>7.8</strong>	These programmes will support the staff to facilitate and deliver support / tasks; and will clearly define expectations for continuous monitoring and review to check how well we are doing.</p> <p><strong>7.9</strong>	Support to increase community engagement will form part of the programme and include activities traditionally known as housing related support. Practical tasks and activities will be identified needs and staff will coach the people we support to increase their daily living and interpersonal skills, relationships with others, knowledge of community opportunities for managing their home, leisure activity, education and work opportunities, etc.</p> <p><strong>7.10</strong>	Community engagement activities will also include:</p> <ul><li>Community awareness raising events</li> <li>Invitations for community to learn more about what we do and how they can help support people with a learning disability and or autism</li> <li>Working with community services to learn about helpful approaches to identifying risk and vulnerability in the people we support and how best to respond</li> <li>Helping community services make adjustments to their services that stop excluding people with a learning disability and or autism</li></ul> <p><strong>7.11</strong>	Tideway Care will seek partnerships with as many community services as is possible and will work with service level agreements to clarify how the relationship can work in practice. Specific SLAs will be agreed with housing providers to establish responsibilities of landlord and tenant</p> <h2 id="_8-review-and-feedback"><a href="#_8-review-and-feedback" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 8. Review and feedback</h2> <p><strong>8.1</strong> <strong>Weekly Review</strong>: We will hold a weekly team review which will focus on the previous week and plan for the subsequent one. People are more accountable for their actions when they express to others what it is they are going to do. These meetings can be brief and succinct or allow for more conversation and discussion; it’s up to you / the team. What works for you /the team? A weekly discussion with each person stating:</p> <ul><li>What did I say I would do?</li> <li>What did I do?</li> <li>What am I going to do next week?</li></ul> <p>In these meetings we look at the measures (lead measures) that if achieved will lead to a metric that shows progress or deterioration over a period of time (lag measure)</p> <p><strong>8.2</strong> <strong>Practice Workshops</strong>: these are held monthly and lead by the PBS Practitioner / Consultant. The workshops will include as much as possible, the person we are supporting, a family representative, the Programme Coach and Programme Facilitators plus any other significant person. The workshops include a review of data collected about activities participated in, incidents, issues emerged, support plan implementation, etc.</p> <p><strong>8.3</strong> <strong>Quarterly Outcome reviews</strong>: The people we support will have a quarterly formal review with the wider circle of support and significant professionals to ensure we have a joint understanding of progress, barriers to progress and agreement about next steps. The meeting will be led by the programme Coach.</p> <p><strong>Satisfaction</strong>:</p> <ul><li><p>It is important that we receive feedback both positive and negative from the people we support so that we can learn about what has a good and poor impact on them. This will help shape service development and ensure that our customer satisfaction is at the forefront of what we do.</p></li> <li><p>In order to provide some consistency, we have developed a customer satisfaction questionnaire so collated results can be shared across similar services, this will enrich the picture we get from respondents.</p></li> <li><p>In addition to using the questionnaire upon exiting the service, the satisfaction questionnaire can be used at different intervals of someone’s stay in our services. If it is a longer-term service a minimum of twice a year is recommended.</p></li></ul> <p>Once each service has collated its feedback there may be some common themes that staff, managers and organisationally we can agree how we improve the services we provide.</p> <h2 id="_9-advanced-directives"><a href="#_9-advanced-directives" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 9. Advanced directives</h2> <p><strong>9.1</strong>	For the purpose of these guidelines, the term advanced directives refers to any plan that details a person’s preferences for treatment and care in the context of potential future needs or wishes to be fulfilled in a given circumstance such as end of life.</p> <p><strong>9.2</strong>	An advance directive may be identified and represented in the form of a person’s Person Centred Plan and or their programme.</p> <p><strong>9.3</strong>	There are many resources to assist the people we support to identify preferences, interests, collaborative risk assessment and management tools and recovery goal setting tools available.  These can help assist the people we support to identify their advanced directives.</p> <p><strong>9.4</strong>	The people we support may have long term high risk physical health issues and may wish to make an advanced directive in relation to this.</p> <h2 id="_10-transitioning-from-tideway-care"><a href="#_10-transitioning-from-tideway-care" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 10. Transitioning from Tideway Care</h2> <p><strong>10.1</strong>	Transition planning is part of a continuum of support we provide; from the first assessment through to participation in the Tideway Care Programme and follow-up support when moving to their next service provider.</p> <p><strong>10.2</strong>	A comprehensive transition plan should be developed before transfer, including links made with other agencies as relevant to the identified needs:</p> <ul><li>Provision of person we support, and family as appropriate, information and education is essential prior to transfer.</li> <li>Sharing of information such as their current Support Plan and Behaviour Support Plan will be necessary for the new provider to be able to continue to support the person.</li> <li>Phased exposure to the new provider and care and support team will be timed at a pace the person we support can achieve the minimal distress possible.</li> <li>Discussing transitioning from the offset of the programme will be embedded in our processes.</li></ul> <p><strong>10.3</strong>	Tideway Care will continue to in-reach into the new provider services for a period of up to 8 weeks post leaving our Tideway Care accommodation and will plan a phased withdrawal with the person transitioning.</p> <p><strong>10.4</strong>	Tideway Care will support the new provider with training sessions for staff where it is deemed helpful by the commissioners.</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - Risk Assessment and Management Procedures</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Mental Health Risk Assessment and Management Procedures</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix03.html">Appendix 3 - Reducing Self Harm Guidelines</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix04.html">Appendix 4 - Substance Misuse Guidance</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP05Appendix05.html">Appendix 5 - Information Sharing Consent Form</a></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">3/5/2019, 11:23:45 AM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
