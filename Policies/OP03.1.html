Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	This policy applies only to those events which have been categorised as a serious incident: all other incidents should be managed as per the <a href="/Policies/OP03.html">OP03 Incident Policy</a>.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	In general terms, a serious incident is something leading to a serious level of harm, unexpected and/or likely to attract public and media interest and may involve a large number of people, poor practice or managerial judgment, a serious service failure or an unexpected death of a person we support in our services.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	Tideway care is committed to organisational learning with the aim of encouraging participation in the overall process and supporting staff throughout.</p> <h2 id="_2-defining-serious-incident-that-requires-investigation-siri-reporting-to-the-nhs"><a href="#_2-defining-serious-incident-that-requires-investigation-siri-reporting-to-the-nhs" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Defining Serious Incident that Requires Investigation (SIRI) reporting to the NHS</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	Tideway Care is a provider of NHS funded services and as such is required to support the NHS SIRI policy and procedures. The reason for reporting SIRIs is to add a layer of protection and scrutiny into serious incidents that will ensure that services are accountable, will investigate rigorously to identify learnings and share learnings widely beyond the service.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	The table in <a href="/Documents/OP03.1Appendix01-Definitions.docx">appendix 1</a> (download link) shows the NHS definitions and our guidance, as a provider of NHS funded services.</p> <h2 id="_3-duties-and-responsibilities"><a href="#_3-duties-and-responsibilities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Duties and Responsibilities</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong> <strong>Operations Director</strong>: The Operations Director has responsibility for the strategic and operational implementation of this policy.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong> <strong>Team Managers</strong>:  Team Managers are responsible for reporting serious incidents to the relevant Commissioner.</p> <ul><li><p>Managers act as the Governance Leads for their services and are responsible for ensuring that all adverse incidents and near misses are reported and managed in line with this policy. They are responsible for reporting the outcome of investigations and sharing with staff.</p></li> <li><p>Team Managers support their staff to attend training, are fully assisted and supported throughout the reporting and handling of a SIRI or serious near miss and receive feedback on the outcome of any investigation.</p></li> <li><p>Where staff experience particular difficulties associated with a SIRI or serious near miss, managers should consider referring the staff member or members to the Occupational Health Department and or the Counselling Service.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>3.3</strong> <strong>Serious Incident Review Group (SIRG)</strong> - The Serious Incident Review Group will be formed from the Tideway Care Senior Management Team who will oversee and monitor the reporting and review of serious untoward incidents. They will ensure that recommendations arising from SIRI investigations are implemented as required and that organisational learning has taken place.</p> <h2 id="_4-procedure"><a href="#_4-procedure" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Procedure</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong> <strong>Immediate action 24/7</strong></p> <ul><li>The witness to the serious incident will:
<ul><li>Ensure the immediate safety of those directly affected by the serious incident</li> <li>Complete an on-line electronic incident form</li> <li>Immediately inform the appropriate senior member of staff/line manager</li></ul></li> <li><strong>The senior member of staff</strong> will:</li> <li>Inform the Senior Management Team via the Operations Director
<ul><li>Ensure notifications are made to the relevant parties as set out below</li> <li>Determine who will speak to the persons family and be the point of contact in accordance with the Duty of Candour requirements</li> <li>Preserve the scene of the incident, if necessary e.g. retention of equipment;</li> <li>Request statements; and</li> <li>Ensure the appropriate support is provided to staff</li></ul></li> <li><strong>The Operations Director</strong> will:
<ul><li>Discuss the details of the incident with the senior management team (SMT) and ensure the relevant policies will be followed if incident is felt to be:
<ul><li>Safeguarding adult incident</li> <li>Safeguarding children incident</li> <li>Whistleblowing</li> <li>Complaints incident</li> <li>Other</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li>Ensure SMT arrange the Initial Investigation Panel meeting aiming to be held within 48 hours</li> <li>Request 24 hour Serious Incident report (see Appendix 2) to be completed and forwarded to the Senior Management Team within 24 hours.</li></ul> <p><strong>4.2</strong> <strong>Within 48 hours of the incident</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>The Managing Director</strong> will ensure:
<ul><li>The Initial Investigation Panel meeting is arranged to take place at the earliest opportunity, aiming to be within 48 hours, and that relevant documentation is available. Attendance at this meeting will include:
<ul><li>The Managing Director who acts as the chair and has responsibility for coordinating the subsequent investigation.</li> <li>Operations Director who will be leading on the investigation</li> <li>Information Governance Lead</li> <li>Strategy and compliance lead who will act as the Risk Advisor</li> <li>Independent member: i.e. somebody to mitigate bias but who has sufficient specialist expertise</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>4.3</strong> <strong>Within 72 hours of the incident being confirmed</strong></p> <ul><li>If the incident relates to a person who is NHS funded, the designated member of the <strong>Senior Management Team</strong> will:
<ul><li>Inform the commissioner and send an anonymised version of the incident report. The commissioner will then report the SIRI via the Strategic Executive Information System (StEIS)</li> <li>Insure all necessary documentation has been completed: Complete checklist (Appendix 3) and insert into the hard copy folder</li> <li>Ensure any external agency has been informed, if required (Appendix 4/5)</li></ul></li> <li><strong>The Lead Investigator</strong> will ensure commencement of the investigation:
<ul><li>Obtaining statements – guidance is available at Appendix 6</li> <li>Arranging, undertaking and documenting interviews</li> <li>Gathering supporting documentation such as policies and guidelines</li> <li>Attend the SIRI panel</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>4.4</strong> <strong>The investigation</strong>: SIRI investigations must be informed by organisational policies and protocols guidelines, interviews, and documented statements of the events. For detailed information on the investigation and report writing process refer to the Tideway Care guidance on the Investigation of Incidents, Complaints and Claims.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong> <strong>Within 6 working weeks of the Initial Investigation Panel meeting</strong></p> <ul><li>The SIRI panel will be held and will:
<ul><li>Agree robust and reasonable recommendations, actions, responsible leads for those actions and timescales for implementation</li> <li>Determine if the investigation has been sufficiently thorough for the SIRI report to be presented to the Serious Incident Review Group</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>4.6</strong> <strong>Within 45 working days</strong>: The Serious Incident Review Group will consider the SIRI report and agree to sign off the report or decide that further investigation is required. If further investigation is required, the Group will return the report to the author for amendment and determine the date for presentation of the updated report.</p> <ul><li>If the report is signed off the Strategy and Compliance lead will ensure:
<ul><li>The final anonymised report is submitted to the CCG</li> <li>A copy of the final report to any affected people we care for or relatives within the timescale required by Duty of Candour</li> <li>A copy of the final anonymised report is available to all staff members involved in contributing to the investigation</li> <li>The CCG will ensure that StEIS is updated, with investigation ‘completed’</li> <li>The Tideway Care Incident database is updated with outcome of the investigation</li></ul></li> <li>If the report is not signed off the Strategy and Compliance lead will ensure:
<ul><li>The reason for the required further investigation and request an extension to the submission deadline</li> <li>Once the final report is signed off the remaining steps in the closure process are followed</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>4.7</strong> <strong>Communicating with and supporting staff</strong>: Where a SIRI has occurred all members of staff directly involved must be kept informed and appropriately communicated with: this is crucial to the development of an open and honest reporting culture. The communication will be through the SMT structure and should include information about the investigative process, the likely timeframe for completion and, most importantly the outcome of the investigation and any actions that will be taken to prevent a similar incident happening again.</p> <p><strong>4.8</strong>	Where staff experience particular difficulties as a result of a SIRI, it is essential that they feel supported. Support for staff can take a number of forms: what is right for one member of staff or one situation may not be right for another. Managers should also be aware that staff needs change over time and as they come to terms with events. Sensitive and ongoing communication will ensure that needs are identified and addressed wherever possible. As well as personal support through the line management structure, managers should also consider referring the staff member or members to the Occupational Health Department or counselling.</p> <p><strong>4.9</strong> <strong>Communicating with and supporting people support, carers and relatives</strong>: When things go wrong one of the biggest concerns for people we support, relatives and carers who have been affected by a SIRI is lack of information. Providing factual information in a sensitive way is helpful and is not an admission of liability for the incident itself. Tideway Care is required to comply with Duty of Candour and contact the person we support or relatives within 10 working days of the incident being declared a SIRI.</p> <p><strong>4.10</strong>	The person with responsibility for communicating with people we support’s relatives or carers will be decided at the Initial Investigation Panel meeting.</p> <h2 id="_5-organisational-learning"><a href="#_5-organisational-learning" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5.
