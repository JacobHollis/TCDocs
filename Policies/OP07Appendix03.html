This section gives doctors time to decide</p> <ul><li>what type of mental disorder you have</li> <li>if you need any treatment</li> <li>how treatment will affect your health</li></ul> <p>An approved mental health professional (AMHP) is more likely to use section 2 than section 3 if:</p> <ul><li>you have never been assessed in hospital before</li> <li>you have not been assessed for a long time</li></ul> <p>A psychiatrist may offer you treatment. If you refuse treatment, the staff may be able to give it to you without your permission.
You can be detained if:</p> <ul><li>you have a mental disorder</li> <li>you are unwell enough to need to be in hospital for an assessment</li> <li>professionals think you should be in hospital for your own health or safety, or to protect other people</li></ul> <p><strong>How will I be detained?</strong> 	An approved mental health professional (AMHP) needs to apply to hospital. Your nearest relative can also do this, but this is rare.</p> <p>An AMHP can only apply if they have seen you in the last 14 days. They also need recommendations from 2 doctors. One of these doctors must have seen you in the last 14 days. And the doctors must not have seen you more than 5 days apart.</p> <p><strong>How long can I be kept in hospital?</strong> Up to 28 days. But this doesn’t mean you will be in hospital for that long. Your doctor should discharge you from section 2 if you don’t meet the criteria for detention any more.</p> <p>Hospital staff cannot extend a section 2. If you need treatment in hospital for longer, you will need to go on to a section 3.
You can stay on a section 2 longer than 28 days if the county court is thinking about changing your nearest relative.</p> <p><strong>What are my rights on a section 2?</strong>
You have the following rights when you are under section 2:</p> <ul><li>To appeal to a tribunal during the first 14 days</li> <li>To appeal to the hospital managers</li> <li>To see an Independent Mental Health Advocate (IMHA), who can help you to understand your rights, and get your voice heard</li></ul> <p><strong>Can they give me treatment I don’t want?</strong>
Yes. But the staff should ask you to accept treatment first. If you are unhappy about your treatment, talk to the person in charge of your care (your responsible clinician). An Independent Mental Health Advocate (IMHA) may be able to help.
Staff can only give you some treatments, like electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), if certain criteria are met.</p> <p><strong>Who can discharge me?</strong>
You can be discharged by:</p> <ul><li>your responsible clinician</li> <li>the hospital managers</li> <li>your nearest relative</li> <li>the tribunal</li></ul> <p><strong>What happens next?</strong>
If your doctor thinks you should stay in hospital longer than 28 days, and you won’t agree to this, they may put you on a section 3.</p> <h3 id="section-3-–-treatment"><a href="#section-3-–-treatment" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Section 3 – Treatment</h3> <p>Under section 3, you can be detained in hospital for treatment for up to 6 months. But it can be extended for longer.</p> <p><strong>When can I be detained?</strong>
You can be detained if:</p> <ul><li>you have a mental disorder</li> <li>you are unwell enough to be in hospital</li> <li>professionals think you should be in hospital for your own health or safety, or to protect other people</li> <li>appropriate treatment is available for you</li> <li>you will not get this treatment unless you are detained</li></ul> <p><strong>How is a section 3 carried out?</strong>
An approved mental health professional (AMHP) needs to apply to hospital. Your nearest relative can also do this, but this is rare.</p> <p><strong>How long will I be in hospital for?</strong>
To start with, you can be detained for up to 6 months. But your doctor can discharge you earlier, if they think you are well enough.</p> <p>If your doctor thinks you need to stay in hospital at the end of the first 6 months, they can renew your section for another 6 months. After that, they can renew it for 1 year at a time.</p> <p>If your responsible clinician thinks your section should be renewed, they have to assess you in the 2 months before it ends. They will then write a report for the hospital managers.</p> <p><strong>What are my rights?</strong>
You have the following rights when you’re under section 3:</p> <ul><li>You can appeal to a tribunal once in the first 6 months</li> <li>If your section is renewed, you can appeal once every time it is renewed</li> <li>You can ask the hospital managers to discharge you</li> <li>You can ask for the help of an Independent Mental Health Advocate (IMHA). They can help you to understand your rights, and to get your voice heard</li></ul> <p><strong>Can I be treated against my will?</strong>
You can be treated against your will for 3 months. After 3 months, staff can only treat you without your consent if a ‘second opinion approved doctor’ (SOAD) approves the treatment.</p> <p>If you are unhappy about your treatment, you should talk to your responsible clinician. An Independent Mental Health Advocate (IMHA) may be able to help.</p> <p>Staff can only give you some treatments, like electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), if certain criteria are met.</p> <p><strong>Who can discharge me?</strong>
You can be discharged by:</p> <ul><li>the professional in charge of your care (known as your ‘responsible clinician’)</li> <li>the hospital managers</li> <li>your nearest relative</li> <li>the tribunal</li></ul> <p><strong>What happens next?</strong>
When you leave hospital, you will get free aftercare. This is known as section 117 aftercare. It is likely that mental health services will plan your care under the ‘Care Programme Approach’.</p> <h3 id="section-4-–-emergencies"><a href="#section-4-–-emergencies" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Section 4 – Emergencies</h3> <p>Section 4 is used in emergencies, where only 1 doctor is available at short notice. Unlike a section 2 or 3, you can be detained with a recommendation from only 1 doctor. You can be kept for up to 72 hours. This gives the hospital time to arrange a full assessment.</p> <p><strong>When can I be detained?</strong>
You can be detained under section 4 if:</p> <ul><li>you have a mental disorder</li> <li>you are unwell enough to be in hospital</li> <li>professionals think you should be in hospital for your own health or safety, or to protect other people</li> <li>it is urgent and necessary for you to be in hospital, and finding another doctor would cause an &quot;undesirable delay&quot;</li></ul> <p><strong>How is section 4 carried out?</strong>
An approved mental health professional (AMHP) needs to apply to hospital. Your nearest relative can also do this, but this is rare.</p> <p>You must have been seen by a doctor in the last 24 hours. The doctor will write a report that says you should be detained.</p> <p><strong>How long can I be detained for?</strong>
You can be detained for up to 72 hours. But this does not mean that you will be kept for this long. A second doctor should assess you as soon as possible. They will decide if the section 4 should be changed to a section 2. The AMHP does not need to make another application to change the section 4 to a section 2.</p> <p><strong>Can I be treated against my will?</strong>
You can refuse treatment. Staff can only treat you without your consent if:</p> <ul><li>you do not have the mental capacity to make a decision about treatment</li> <li>the treatment is in your best interests</li></ul> <p><strong>Who can discharge me?</strong>
You can be discharged by the professional in charge of your care in hospital. They are called your responsible clinician.</p> <h3 id="section-5-–-holding-powers"><a href="#section-5-–-holding-powers" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Section 5 – Holding powers</h3> <p>Section 5 allows a doctor or nurse to stop you from leaving hospital. They may do this if you are in hospital voluntarily, and you want to leave. But they think you are too unwell to leave.</p> <p>If you are in hospital voluntarily, and you are on a locked ward, staff either have to:</p> <ul><li>let you leave when you want to</li> <li>use their section 5 powers</li></ul> <p>If they stop you from leaving without using section 5, this is against the law.</p> <p>Section 5 allows a doctor or nurse to stop you from leaving hospital. They may do this if you are in hospital voluntarily, and you want to leave. But they think you are too unwell to leave.</p> <p>If you are in hospital voluntarily, and you are on a locked ward, staff either have to:</p> <ul><li>let you leave when you want to, or</li> <li>use their section 5 powers.</li></ul> <p>If they stop you from leaving without using section 5, this is against the law.</p> <p>Staff should only use section 5 when it is not possible or safe to use sections 2, 3, or 4.</p> <p><strong>Doctor’s holding power – section 5(2)</strong>
A doctor can hold you in hospital for up to 72 hours, if they write a report explaining why you need to be detained, and send this to the hospital managers. A doctor can do this in any hospital.</p> <p><strong>Nurse’s holding power – section 5(4)</strong>
A mental health or learning disability nurse can keep you in hospital for up to 6 hours if:</p> <ul><li>they need to immediately stop you leaving hospital, for your own health or safety, or for the protection of others, and</li> <li>it is not possible to find a doctor who can section you under section 5(2).</li></ul> <p><strong>How long can I be detained for?</strong></p> <ul><li><p>Under section 5(2)
You can be held for up to 72 hours. The doctor cannot renew or extend it. An approved mental health professional (AMHP) and doctors must assess you as soon as possible to see if you should be detained under section 2 or 3.</p></li> <li><p>Under section 5(4)
A nurse can keep you in hospital for up to 6 hours. This is not renewable. The holding power ends as soon as a doctor arrives.</p></li></ul> <p>The doctor may transfer you onto a section 2, 3, or 5(2). Or you may continue as a voluntary patient.</p> <p><strong>Can I be treated against my will?</strong>
You can refuse treatment. Staff can only treat you without your consent if:</p> <ul><li>you do not have the mental capacity to make a decision about treatment, and</li> <li>the treatment is in your best interests.</li></ul> <p>If you have the capacity to make your own decisions, staff cannot treat you without your consent, unless they move you to a section 2 or 3.</p> <p>Section 5 ends when:</p> <ul><li>the time runs out, or</li> <li>you are detained under a different section.</li></ul> <p>If the time runs out, and the staff have not detained you under another section, you should be able to leave.</p> <h3 id="section-37-41-court-order"><a href="#section-37-41-court-order" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Section 37/ 41 Court Order</h3> <ul><li>The criminal courts can use section 37 if they think you should be in hospital instead of prison. Section 41 is a restriction order. The Crown Court can add this order to a section 37 if they feel you are a risk to the public. You can appeal to the courts if you do not agree with this sentence</li> <li>You need to appeal in a certain time period so you should get legal advice from a solicitor. You can appeal to the Hospital Managers and the Mental Health Review Tribunal (MHRT). However, the Secretary of State for Justice (the Ministry of Justice) decides when you can leave</li> <li>The hospital can treat you without your permission for up to 3 months</li></ul> <p>The judge has the option of adding a section 41 restriction order to this, making the section a 37/41. The judge in a Crown Court can do this if they think you are a risk to the public. The restriction order means that there are restrictions on you and your Responsible Clinician (RC). One restriction is that your RC needs to get permission from the Secretary of State for Justice before they can discharge you.</p> <p>The powers in Section 41 are flexible but may include that you live at a specified place and accept treatment for your mental illness. However, treatment can only be given with your consent. You could also be required to keep appointments with your supervisor who will usually be an approved mental health professional (AMHP) or probation officer and also with your responsible clinician.
If you fail to comply with the conditions the Ministry of Justice will be informed and you could be recalled to hospital. The original Section 37/41 would then be reinstated.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/8/2018, 3:38:46 PM</span></div></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
