Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	The success of Tideway Care relies on the people we employ and support to deliver the best of care and to work as a team to be effective and consistent in their delivery. We recruit a staff team that is motivated to make a meaningful impact to people's lives, ensure people are happy to come to work and believe in what they are doing.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	We are therefore committed to recruiting and retaining a skilled, competent, and motivated workforce who want to achieve the best for the people we support.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	Tideway Care ensures it has in place the resources required to ensure our staff have the leadership, guidance and tools to succeed in their workplace.</p> <h2 id="_2-employment-checks"><a href="#_2-employment-checks" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Employment checks</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS): The DBS check will apply to all employees and prospective employees including bank workers. Agency staff will have had an appropriate DBS disclosure, where appropriate by their employing agency.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong> <strong>Occupational Health</strong>: The OH checks are carried out to:</p> <ul><li><p>ensure that prospective staff are physically and psychologically capable of doing the work proposed, taking into account any current or previous illness</p></li> <li><p>identify anyone likely to be at excess risk of developing work-related conditions which may lead to them developing health issues due to any identified risks present in the workplace</p></li> <li><p>ensure, as far as possible, that the prospective employee does not represent a risk to the people we support and that they will be doing work that is suitable and safe for them.</p></li></ul> <p>All checks must take into account the requirements of the Equality Act (2010) and reasonable adjustments must be made to ensure that people can work with us, regardless of any protected characteristic.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong> <strong>UK Rights to Work</strong>: We will check that a job applicant is allowed to work in the UK before we employ them. The check will ensure we see the applicant’s original documents and that the documents are valid with the applicant present. We will make and keep copies of the documents and record the date we made the check. See <a href="/Policies/HR02Appendix03.html">Appendix 3 - Right to Work Check Identification</a> for details of valid documents</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong> <strong>References:</strong> It is our policy to seek a minimum of two written references and we will request them prior to interview unless the candidate specifies they want them to be requested only if they are successful. If we are unsure about what a written reference is telling us we will request a phone call with the referee to clarify their experience of the candidate.</p> <h2 id="_3-our-recruitment-principles"><a href="#_3-our-recruitment-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Our recruitment principles</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong> <strong>Equal Opportunities</strong>: we treat everyone with consistency and ensure people are not discriminated against because of a personal characteristic such as their religion, gender or age.  Discrimination can include:</p> <ul><li>not hiring someone because of a protected characteristic</li> <li>selecting a particular person for redundancy based on a protected characteristic</li> <li>paying someone less than another worker for the same job without good reason</li></ul> <p>We will check that our working conditions do not unfairly disadvantage anyone who may have specific needs; e.g. disabled access</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong> <strong>Experts by Experience</strong>: We will positively include people who have experience of living with a person with a learning disability or who has a learning disability in our workforce. We see them as having assets that will enhance the process and interview experience.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong> <strong>Value Based Recruitment</strong>: Tideway Care has adopted Values Based Recruitment (VBR) where we seek to recruit staff with values that fit with our organisational values. These values define our behaviour and conduct at work and will be the guiding principles that will set out how we will work regardless of our role. See <a href="/Policies/HR02Appendix01.html">Appendix 1</a> for some suggestions on value-based questions and how you would score the responses.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong> <strong>Quality Assurance</strong>: We pride ourselves in being able to be robust on our recruitment processes and will always seek to improve. We will therefore check through audits and gaining participant feedback from the interview panel and candidates.</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong> <strong>Positive Behaviours</strong>: Tideway Care will support all candidates positively and seek to get the best out of them. Any process for helping select the right candidate will be aimed at getting the best out of them; putting them at ease, not putting them in intimidating environments, being welcoming and warm in our reception and communication.</p> <h2 id="_4-recruitment-process"><a href="#_4-recruitment-process" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Recruitment process</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	All staff vacancies will be identified by the Team Manager and agreed by Operations Director who will review the staff mix and team needs together.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	They will review the job role, the associated Job Description (JD) and Job Specification (JS) within one week of the vacancy being agreed to ensure they meet the team resourcing needs.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	They will also agree the content of the advert and route to advertising and ensure the advert is published within 2 weeks from the vacancy being approved.</p> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	Applications will be collated, and the selection panel appointed to interview and the interview panel chairperson to be appointed by the Operations Director. The interview panel for the post will meet to review the standardised shortlisting criteria and scoring process before shortlisting the applications. The panel will include experts by experience who will have had training / coaching on the interview process and our responsibilities in equal opportunities and confidentiality.  Shortlisting is held within 4 weeks from the vacancy being approved.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong>	When arranging interviews proper consideration should be made to ensuring there is sufficient time allocated to give each interview a fair shot and ensure interview panels are not fatigued when making decisions. It is good practice to not arrange more than 4 interviews in one day and to ensure timeslots are arranged with sufficient space in between interviews to allow the panel to reflect and prepare themselves for the next interview.</p> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	When an advertised role attracts a large number of suitable applicants and it becomes difficult to create a shortlist the hiring manager may arrange a workshop and invite the applicants to attend. Information gathered from these workshops can be used to further shortlist applicants. If a workshop is required, the interview panel will organise with a group of experts by experience and our partners. The event will have clear criteria for further shortlisting.</p> <p><strong>4.7</strong>	Once shortlist is agreed the successful candidates are notified following within 24 hours of the agreement. The interview panel will agree the format of interview prior to the interview and may include combinations of the following.</p> <ul><li>practical assessment</li> <li>presentation</li> <li>interview</li></ul> <p>Each phase will have scoring criteria agreed by the panel who can use the Tideway Care standard format as a guide to assist the selection process.</p> <p><strong>4.8</strong>	The interview panel will convene the interviews within 6 weeks of the vacancy being agreed and will progress the decision-making process. Once they have agreed who the successful candidate is, the chairperson of the panel will inform the candidates of the outcome agreed.</p> <p><strong>4.9</strong>	When letting unsuccessful candidates know of the outcome of the interview the feedback must be constructive and supportive. We will have a space on the interview assessment forms to guide this and the panel can help with constructive comments.</p> <p><strong>4.10</strong>	For the successful candidate/s the offer of the job must be subject to the necessary employment and occupational health checks; this includes references, DBS and rights to work in the UK checks.</p> <p><strong>4.11</strong>	Once the necessary employment checks have been successfully completed, the contract can be completed and signed off by the Operations Director.</p> <p><strong>4.12</strong>	The contract will follow the Tideway Care Format detailing the working hours, salary, start date and terms and conditions of employment.</p> <p><strong>4.13</strong>	Two copies of the contract to be sent to the successful candidate for them to sign and return a copy and retain a copy for their own records.</p> <h2 id="_5-starter-process"><a href="#_5-starter-process" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Starter Process</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	The Team Manager of the service recruiting will complete all the necessary documentation to assist the starter process. This will be checked and signed off by the Operations Director. For Team Manager posts the Operations Director will complete the starter process.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	The Team Manager will ensure that the necessary preparation for the new staff member is carried out prior to start; e.g. induction plan ready, mandatory training clarified, etc.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong>	On the starter day the Team Manager will ensure they are available to meet the new starter and welcome them.</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <p><a href="/Policies/HR02Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - Value Based Recruitment - Example Questions</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/HR02Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Recruitment and Selection Process Summary</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/HR02Appendix03.html">Appendix 3 - Right to Work Check Identification</a></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/7/2018, 10:57:29 AM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
