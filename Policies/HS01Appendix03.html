The main law covering this is the Manual Handling Operations Regulations. These are covered in detail in UNISON’s guide to the ‘six pack’ In brief, the regulations state that employers must do the following:</li></ol> <ul><li>Avoid the need for hazardous manual handling work as far as is reasonably practicable</li> <li>Remove or reduce the risk of injury using the risk assessment as the basis for action</li> <li>Ensure loads are marked</li> <li>Provide staff with training and information</li> <li>Review and monitor control measures</li></ul> <ol start="2"><li>Training in proper lifting techniques is important, but must not be a substitute for employers reducing the risks in the first place:
Training to include:</li></ol> <ul><li>All manual handling situations likely to be faced by home care workers</li> <li>Any particular hazards they may face and the precautions they should take</li> <li>How to carry out on- the- spot evaluations</li> <li>Who to contact for advice on specific manual  handling problems</li></ul> <ol start="3"><li><p>Particular attention and support will be available for workers, who may be pregnant, have a disability or have a health problem.</p></li> <li><p>Our Team Managers help to make the Manual Handling Regulations work by:</p></li></ol> <ul><li>Making sure staff assess all manual handling tasks carried out by home care workers</li> <li>Ensuring that the home care workers’ task, load, work method and work area are covered in the people we support’s assessment and support plan</li> <li>Reporting any omissions via the incident reporting system</li> <li>Ensuring that home care workers record and report any health problems or injuries relating to lifting and/or manual handling hazards</li> <li>Making sure possible handling problems are considered in the support plan and before changes are made to work methods, the people we support’s home or before new equipment are introduced</li> <li>Ensuring that manual handling training is provided.</li></ul> <ol start="5"><li>Case Law</li></ol> <ul><li><p>In 2003 the High Court gave judgment in a case involving lifting of people in care homes. This weighed  up the responsibility of employers to protect staff from injury through manual handling and their duties to clients under the Disability Discrimination Act and Human Rights Act.</p></li> <li><p>There has been some confusion over what the judgement actually means and as a result some UNISON members have been asked by management to lift an adult client alone. This is an incorrect interpretation of the High Court ruling. No member of staff should ever be asked to take the full weight of another adult and to do so is to put that worker at serious risk of back injury.</p></li> <li><p>The court action arose because a local authority used guidance issued by the Royal College of Nursing that stated ‘Manual lifting of patients is eliminated in all but exceptional or life threatening situations’. This was interpreted as meaning that manual handling should never be done, even by a group of staff. The court instead suggested that the local authority should have followed the guidance of the Health and Safety Executive ‘Handling Home Care: Achieving safe, efficient and positive outcomes for care workers and clients’.</p></li> <li><p>UNISON has always taken the view that manual handling should be avoided where possible. Although in some cases it is necessary, because of the individual needs of the client, for manual assistance to be given.</p></li> <li><p>However, no one person should ever take the full weight of another adult person and manual lifting should only be done where:</p> <ul><li>A suitable number of staff are available</li> <li>A risk assessment has been done</li> <li>Staff have been given proper training</li> <li>No other reasonable alternative is available.</li></ul></li> <li><p>In deciding what form of lifting should be carried out, the views of the people we support should also be taken into account. This approach mirrors the view of the Health and Safety Executive in the guidance that was supported by the High Court decision. This guidance gives practical advice on how to ensure that workers are not put at risk and at the same time the rights of the client are protected. It gives helpful case studies to  illustrate how this can be done safely.</p></li></ul> <ol start="6"><li><p>UNISON has supported the use of the Health and Safety Executive guidance within the Home Care Service ; Tideway Care have based this policy on this guidance and have used a large amount of it’s contents.</p></li> <li><p>Manual Handling techniques: Manual handling accidents, as a result of pushing, pulling or lifting heavy objects or machinery, account for more than a third of all reported accidents each year. This short guide provides the best manual handling techniques to follow in the workplace so that you can reduce the likelihood of injury occurring.</p></li></ol> <h3 id="what-is-manual-handling"><a href="#what-is-manual-handling" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Manual Handling?</h3> <p>Moving and handling, also known as ‘manual handling’, is any action involving physical effort to move or support an object or person by:</p> <ul><li>Lifting</li> <li>Pushing</li> <li>Pulling</li> <li>Manoeuvring</li> <li>Steadying</li> <li>Carrying</li> <li>Transporting</li></ul> <p>By law, employers are required to undertake a risk assessment and do everything that is reasonably practicable in order to reduce the risks associated with manual handling. Amongst other actions, this includes introducing control measures to ensure workers understand how to lift, push and pull correctly, using mechanical aids where available and reducing the need for manual handling altogether.</p> <h3 id="a-manual-handling-techniques-for-lifting"><a href="#a-manual-handling-techniques-for-lifting" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> A. Manual Handling Techniques for Lifting</h3> <p><img src="/images/ManualHandlingFig1.jpg" alt="Manual Handling Techniques" title="Manual Handling Techniques"></p> <ul><li><p>Before lifting an item, think: Can you use a manual handling aid instead? Where is the load being moved to? Are there any obstructions that may get in the way?</p></li> <li><p>Adopt a stable position with feet apart and one leg slightly forward to maintain stability. Make sure that you are wearing suitable footwear.</p></li> <li><p>Get a good hold on the load and hug it close to your body where possible. At the start of the lift, bending at the back, knees and hips is preferable to fully bending the back or squatting.</p></li> <li><p>When carrying, keep the load close to your waist for as long as possible. Put the heaviest side of the load closest to your body. Keep your head up and look ahead, not down at the load, and avoid twisting or leaning sideways.</p></li> <li><p>If you need to, put the load down and adjust your grip before continuing the lift.</p></li></ul> <h4 id="when-pushing-or-pulling-a-load-the-health-and-safety-executive-provides-the-following-guidance"><a href="#when-pushing-or-pulling-a-load-the-health-and-safety-executive-provides-the-following-guidance" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> When pushing or pulling a load, the Health and Safety Executive provides the following guidance:</h4> <h3 id="b-pushing-or-pulling-loads"><a href="#b-pushing-or-pulling-loads" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> B. Pushing or Pulling Loads</h3> <ul><li>Use an aid with a handle height that is between shoulder and waist height.</li> <li>Ensure that pushing or pulling equipment is well maintained.</li> <li>As a guide, the amount of force that needs to be applied to move a load over a flat surface is at least 2% of the load weight. For example, if the load is 400kg, then the force needs to be 8kg.</li> <li>The force for pushing or pulling will be greater over imperfect conditions.</li> <li>Always try to push rather than pull where possible.</li> <li>When negotiating a slop or ramp, get help from another worker.</li> <li>On an uneven surface, increase the pushing/pulling force to 10% of the load weight.</li> <li>To make it easier to push or pull, keep your feet well away from the load and move no faster than walking speed</li></ul> <h3 id="c-lifting-from-low-levels"><a href="#c-lifting-from-low-levels" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> C. Lifting from Low Levels</h3> <ul><li>Think about the load – where is it going? Is it heavy? Do you need help?</li> <li>Remove obstructions that may get in the way.</li> <li>Keep the load close to the body.</li> <li>Keep the heaviest side of the load next to the body so that it doesn’t tip up.</li> <li>Adopt a stable position – adjust your feet for stability if needed.</li> <li>Get a good grip.</li> <li>Start with a good posture and keep your back straight.</li> <li>Avoid twisting or leaning.</li> <li>Look forwards and keep your head up.</li></ul> <h3 id="d-lowering-from-height"><a href="#d-lowering-from-height" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> D. Lowering from Height</h3> <ul><li>Follow the HSE recommended guidelines for maximum lowering weights.</li> <li>Grasp the load with both hands.</li> <li>Adopt a stable position.</li> <li>Allow time for pauses to rest.</li> <li>Reduce the amount of weight being lifted if the operation is repeated more often.</li></ul> <h3 id="e-carrying"><a href="#e-carrying" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> E. Carrying</h3> <ul><li>Move smoothly and slowly.</li> <li>Don’t lift more than you can comfortably carry.</li> <li>Put down the load and adjust your grip if necessary.</li></ul> <h3 id="f-pushing-and-pulling"><a href="#f-pushing-and-pulling" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> F.
