Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care believes that the people we support have the right to understand what their medication is for, the importance of safe storage and how they can manage their medication more independently.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	This policy and procedures provide a framework to positively encourage the people we support to manage their medication and to ensure systems are in place to assist those who require support to do so.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	The safe storage, handling, dispensing, administration and recording of medicines is important to ensure we safeguard the people we support from harm.</p> <h2 id="_2-underlying-principles"><a href="#_2-underlying-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Underlying Principles</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	All staff involved in a person’s care are responsible for ensuring that medication is managed appropriately. The primary responsibility for the prescribing and monitoring of medication and the person’s condition rests with their General Practitioner (GP) in consultation with other healthcare professionals involved in the care of that individual.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	People should be encouraged, where appropriate, and following a risk assessment, to retain, self-administer and control their own medication in order to maximise their independence and retain control over their own lives. People who have been assessed as being unable to manage their own medication without assistance need to be supported to understand and manage their medication.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	Medication management support must be underpinned by the following values:</p> <ul><li><p>Respecting the person’s choice and dignity</p></li> <li><p>Seeking to maximise the person’s independence</p></li> <li><p>Responding flexibly in order to accommodate the person’s changing needs</p> <p><strong>2.3.1</strong>	For the people we support to be involved in their own medication management, accessible information will be made available to them. We will utilise different media to assist the people we support to understand their medicines and utilise assistive technology where helpful to them.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	All staff will have training on medicines management and understand the importance of their role in helping the people we support manage their own medicines.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong> Documentation relating to medication of people we support must be clear and roles and responsibilities identified explicitly. The care notes and support plans will reflect the needs of these individuals and how those needs are met.</p> <p><strong>2.6</strong> We will seek alternative solutions to identified areas of concern or challenge on behalf of the people we support; e.g. suggesting alternative packaging of medicine if available. You may need to support them to request a prescription review or to work with their General Practitioner if the person would prefer their medicine in liquid form as opposed to tablet.</p> <p><strong>2.7</strong> We fully advocate the STOMP (‘Stop Over Medicating People with a learning disability, autism or both with psychotropic medicines’ and will seek to reduce the use of antipsychotic medicines.</p> <p><strong>2.8</strong> We are transparent about when things go wrong, and any medication incidents are reported in a timely manner to the appropriate people.</p> <h2 id="_3-mental-capacity"><a href="#_3-mental-capacity" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Mental Capacity</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong> <strong>The Operations Director</strong> has overall responsibility for the implementation of this policy and procedure and delegates service level monitoring of achievement of the policy to the Team Managers.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong> <strong>The Programme Coaches</strong>  will work with each person they support to identify their medication management needs. They will utilise the Health Action Plan template to identify all prescribed Medication and discuss with the person how they want to be supported with it.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong> Initially a person may not be able to manage their own medication; the Programme Coaches will work with the local GP and pharmacist to identify the best way to support the person with their medication. They may use the medication management Assessment Form to assist them.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong> As part of goal planning the Programme Coach will integrate medication management goals into the support plans with the person they support. They must also consider the person’s preferences in respect of equality and diversity.</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong> Support planning will include guidance on the use of “pro re nata’ (PRN) - which means when necessary in Latin, and antipsychotic medication for the management of behaviours. This will be discussed with the Positive Behaviour Support Practitioner / Consultant / the prescribing doctor to ensure there is a joint understanding about its intended use. The efficacy and use of PRN and antipsychotic medication will be monitored on a regular basis at all reviews.</p> <p><strong>3.6</strong> Guidelines on when PRN is appropriate will be written in the Positive Behaviour Support plans or Physical Health support plans as required.</p> <p><strong>3.7</strong> The Programme Coach must review support plans at least quarterly and whenever they, health professionals or relevant others identify the need for change in practice – for example, through reference to learning logs or monthly reviews. This includes relevant information captured on health action plans.</p> <p><strong>3.8</strong> The Programme Coach must ensure that a person has an annual medicine review undertaken by a doctor, which considers the full medication needs of the person as opposed to a specific review of a medication.  this should involve their prescribing health professionals and all relevant other stakeholders – for example, relatives or advocates and care manager. The pharmacists can also undertake a Medicines Use Review (MUR) which will help the people we support understand whether they are getting maximum benefit from their medication. This can be undertaken annually.  The Team Manager will monitor all medication reviews being completed and work with the Programme Coach to ensure they are undertaken as planned.</p> <p><strong>3.9</strong> <strong>The Programme Facilitators</strong> are responsible for ensuring the support plans are followed and report any concerns they have in relation to their implementation.</p> <p><strong>3.10</strong>	The local pharmacists can offer advice and guidance for the safe storage and disposal of medicines, medicines use and potential interactions and can provide information about homely remedies – i.e. over the counter products.</p> <p><strong>3.11</strong>	In respect of medicine management, local authorities may require actions or procedures of us that we do not describe in this policy. Similarly, they may require us to use their paperwork. Where contractually bound, we must abide by the contract.</p> <h2 id="_4-level-of-medication-support-and-training"><a href="#_4-level-of-medication-support-and-training" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Level of Medication Support and Training</h2> <p>There are three recognised levels of support with medication:</p> <p><strong>4.1</strong> <strong>Level 1: General support tasks</strong><br>
These are tasks you would perform for the people we support who self-medicate. Assistance would be physical only – for example, you unscrew a lid for them – or take the form of an occasional prompt. Their pharmacists can make a note if they require easy open caps and flag this for the dispensing of medicines to the individual. Supporting them to collect their medications from the pharmacy and checking they are correct and helping them with any aids they use if required. Facilitating a medication, clinical and use review by asking the person about any issues with their medicines.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong> <strong>Level 2: Administration by care staff</strong>
These include:</p> <ul><li>Frequent reminders to take medication</li> <li>Selecting the correct medicine</li> <li>Leaving out medication to be taken later</li> <li>Administration of oral medication</li> <li>Measuring out doses of liquid medication (where prescription indicates you are responsible for ensuring the person receives the correct amount)</li> <li>Administering inhaler devices</li> <li>Applying external medicated creams, ointments, gels, and so on</li> <li>Applying transdermal patches</li> <li>Applying medication to the eye, nose or ear</li> <li>Giving medicines via a nebuliser</li> <li>This list is not exhaustive</li></ul> <p><strong>4.3</strong> <strong>Level 3: Administration by specialist technique</strong>
For example, but this list is not exhaustive:</p> <ul><li>Rectal administrations – for example, suppositories, enemas</li> <li>Vaginal administrations – for example, pessaries</li> <li>Injections – for example, insulin</li> <li>Administration through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)</li> <li>Buccal route administration</li> <li>Giving oxygen</li></ul> <h2 id="_5-staff-training"><a href="#_5-staff-training" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5.	Staff Training</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong> All staff including agency and temporary staff will be trained to competency Level 1

The aims of this training are:</p> <ul><li>To enable to staff to feel confident in the safe administration and management of medication through completion of the online training module: Safe administration of medication Level 2</li> <li>To check full understanding of critical safety issues relating to the administration of medicines through completion and passing of Tideway Care’s written assessment.</li> <li>To validate learning through Tideway Care’s observed competency assessment; staff will not be able to administer medicines until they have completed this assessment.</li></ul> <p><strong>5.3</strong>	Each step of the training above will be undertaken annually or before if there are any concerns from a line manager about a staff member’s competency. Each step will also be undertaken on a separate day.</p> <p><strong>5.4</strong>	All Team Managers, Programme Coaches and other staff working with people who require staff to administer their medication by a specialist technique will be trained to competency Level 3.</p> <p><strong>5.5</strong>	The aims of this training are:</p> <ul><li>For staff to be confident in the safe administration of medicines via specialist / invasive techniques by completion of face to face training with a qualified and registered health professional who will sign the staff off as competent.</li></ul> <p><strong>5.6</strong>	No staff member can undertake administration of medicine via specialist or invasive techniques until they have been signed off as competent. Refresher training to be undertaken annually as a minimum. A declaration of competency will be completed annually.</p> <p><strong>5.7</strong>	All training will be logged and signed off in the staff training and development system which will monitor who has completed and passed each level of training. Mangers will be prompted when refreshers are required by the system.</p> <p><strong>5.8</strong>	This training requirement applies to temporary and agency staff; however, Tideway Care will accept that agency staff have been trained to the appropriate levels on sharing of their training records.</p> <p><strong>5.9</strong>	Managers are expected to ensure that only competent staff will provide support to those who need help with administration of medicines. The level of support required will be noted in an individual’s support plans and this must be taken into account when selecting members of staff for a shift that may require medication support.</p> <h2 id="_6-safe-storage-of-medicines"><a href="#_6-safe-storage-of-medicines" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6.	Safe Storage of Medicines</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong> <strong>In residential services</strong>, all medication must be stored in lockable cupboards or in a lockable drug fridge or in individual lockable cupboards in the individual’s room.</p> <p>In some services the medication may be stored for more than one individual in a central location under the supervision of staff in an office or specified lockable staff room; you must store medicines for which you are responsible in a suitable cupboard that is locked at all times except for the purpose of legitimate access.</p> <p>According to best practice guidelines, this cupboard should be:</p> <ul><li>purpose-made</li> <li>made from metal</li> <li>secured to a wall</li> <li>and sited in a room to which only those administering medicines have access</li> <li>where it does not detract from the homeliness of the care home</li> <li>where it will not attract the attention of passers-by outside the care home</li></ul> <p>Also according to best practice guidance, places that are not suitable for storage include:</p> <ul><li>filing cabinets</li> <li>kitchens</li> <li>bathrooms</li> <li>toilets</li> <li>sluices</li> <li>windowsills</li> <li>areas next to heaters</li></ul> <p>You must follow these guidelines where possible. Where not possible, you must risk assess the circumstances.</p> <p>When responsible for medicines, you must store them in accordance with the manufacturer’s requirements. If you are unsure what this is a staff member can help you and you can check.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong> <strong>In a registered care home</strong><br>
Oral and external preparations (i.e. those medications not taken by mouth) should be stored suitably separated. Topical medicines e.g. emollients may be stored in the individual’s room and applied by staff as per their support plan.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	Items requiring fridge storage must be kept in a lockable drug fridge. The temperature of the fridge must be within the range 2-8 degrees Centigrade. A log of temperatures (maximum, minimum and ambient) must be recorded as determined by the requirements of the medication and any temperature that is out of range must be reported to the Manager who will take action to rectify it i.e. by defrosting the fridge or if not effective, calling the service engineer. The fridge must be defrosted and cleaned monthly.</p> <p><strong>6.4</strong>	Room temperature for medication storage is generally between 15-25 degrees Celsius but this may be different for individual medicines – check the information sheet for required temperature storage. An increasing number of medicines are stating maximum storage temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius. A log of room temperatures should be recorded daily. The Manager must be informed if the room temperature exceeds this temperature.</p> <p><strong>6.5</strong> <strong>Controlled Drugs</strong> must be stored in the approved CD cupboard i.e. metal lockable cupboard that conforms to the Misuse of Drugs (safe custody) regulations. It must be bolted to a solid wall. (See Section 14 for storage of Controlled Drugs by people who self-administer).  <strong>See <a href="/Policies/OP12Appendix02.html">Appendix 2</a> for NICE most commonly prescribed controlled drugs.</strong></p> <p><strong>6.6</strong> <strong>Oxygen cylinders</strong><br>
Oxygen cylinders should be stored securely in a dry, secure, clean well-ventilated environment below 50 degrees Celsius:</p> <ul><li>Cylinders should be stored upright</li> <li>Valves must be closed when cylinders are stored</li> <li>Full and empty cylinders should be segregated to avoid confusion in selection.</li> <li>The storage area should be free from combustible material and the cylinder must not be stored in direct contact with a source of heat (e.g. radiator, fire) or combustion (flammable liquids).</li></ul> <p>A warning sign should be displayed on the door indicating the presence of oxygen</p> <ul><li>A procedure in each service should be in place for informing the emergency services of the location of oxygen if they are required to attend in the event of a fire or fire alarm. The location and maximum quantity of oxygen cylinders must be clearly identified on your fire risk assessment</li> <li>In the event of fire you must notify the 999 operator of the presence of oxygen cylinders within the building</li></ul> <p><strong>6.7</strong>	Keys to the medication cupboards and medicines fridge should be held by the person in charge and passed to the next designated person at shift change. Keys must never be left in drawers, left unattended or taken home. Only staff members competent to administer medicines should have access to the keys.</p> <ul><li>Duplicate keys must be held in a secure location.</li> <li>Medication cupboards must never be left opened and unattended.</li> <li>A lockable cupboard or drawer must be available in each individual’s room for safe storage of medicines, if the individual self-administers following a risk assessment.</li> <li>Medication should be date-checked on a weekly basis and stored and used in date order. Expired medication should be returned for disposal via the pharmacy.</li> <li>Medication storage areas including trolleys, cupboards and fridges must be cleaned regularly and checked monthly.</li></ul> <p><strong>6.8</strong> <strong>Domiciliary Care and Supported Living Services</strong> <strong>In Domiciliary Care and individual homes in Supported Living Services</strong>, all current medication should be kept together in a place of safety known and accessible to the individual if appropriate and specified in the support plan. Where this is not appropriate, medication should be kept in a safe place where it is only accessible to family, staff and other healthcare professionals. This should be agreed and noted in the support plan.</p> <p><strong>6.9</strong>	You should offer people the opportunity to store their medicines as they wish, for example in their bedroom as opposed to a centrally controlled medicine cabinet. However, you must advise the person to follow the manufacturer’s storage requirements.</p> <p><strong>6.10</strong>	You must also risk assess the arrangement, taking all reasonable measures to protect both the person concerned and others – for example, housemates and visitors – from misuse and error. In shared homes, these measures must include the provision of a lockable cabinet, tin or drawer and arrangements for the safekeeping of its keys.</p> <p><strong>6.11</strong>	If a person objects to your proposed measures for keeping them and others safe, you must involve relevant others in trying to resolve the matter – for example their doctor, care manager and closest relatives.</p> <h2 id="_7-level-1-general-support-tasks"><a href="#_7-level-1-general-support-tasks" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7.	Level 1 General Support Tasks</h2> <p><strong>7.1</strong>	For people who are self-managing their medications, staff intervention is minimal and may consist of:</p> <ul><li>Checking they are not experiencing any concerns about their medication- e.g. they feel too tired/ they are getting side effects/ etc and reporting to the Programme Coach.</li> <li>Asking them if they have missed any of their doses and reminding them of the importance of taking all prescribed doses</li> <li>Arranging an appointment if they want to have a review of their medication with a doctor</li></ul> <p><strong>7.2</strong> <strong>Level 2 Administration of Medicines</strong><br>
Before administering medicine, you must have received a level 1 induction in the relevant service and achieved level 2 competence.</p> <p><strong>7.3</strong>	You must not administer medicine to more than one person at a time. Read the Medication Administration Record Chart and look at the labels on the containers/ blister packs (Blister packs, also known as compliance packs or bubble packs, can help people to keep track of their medicines. Blister packs contain designated sealed compartments, or spaces for medicines to be taken at particular times of the day. Blister packs are often used by people taking many different medicines and find it difficult to remember when to take their medicines) for each medication.</p> <p><strong>7.4</strong>	When administering medicine you must check you have the:</p> <ul><li>right individual</li> <li>right medicine</li> <li>right dose</li> <li>right time on the right date</li> <li>right route</li> <li>right documentation.
Check the labels on the medication bottles, blister packs, etc and talk it through with the people we support as you check against the MAR sheet.</li></ul> <p><strong>7.5</strong>	You may only administer medicine with the person’s consent. So, you must never give medicine to a person without their knowing unless in exceptional circumstances – see <a href="/Policies/OP12.html#_12-anti-coagulants-e-g-warfarin">section 12.1</a>.</p> <p><strong>7.6</strong>	In some instances, it may be appropriate to crush tablets or open capsules or to make a medicine more palatable by disguising it in food where this is requested, you must have the person’s consent or evidenced agreement that this action is in their best interest.  You must also have the prescriber’s and the pharmacist’s prior permission to alter the method of administration in such a way. This is because crushing tablets or disguising medicine can alter the drug’s integrity. If possible, get written permission and include the evidence in the person’s support plan. If the prescriber and pharmacist are only able to provide verbal permission – for example, because they are advising you over the phone – you must record this advice in the person’s notes, giving as much detail as possible.  If you need to get urgent information, e.g. out of hours, you can refer to the Specific Product Characteristics (SPC) and Patient Leaflet but if possible check with pharmacist. If you are unable to locate the SPC or patient leaflet they can be found at the Electronic Medicines Compendium (EMC) at <a href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p><strong>7.7</strong>	You must not administer medicine from any packaging other than its original packaging with the original label attached. However, if it is easier and safer, you may dispense it into a medication pot or other suitable container as long as you administer the medicine straight away. You must never place a tablet directly into somebody’s mouth using your fingers, e.g. if the people we support asks you to because they feel it’s too fiddly for them to do it themselves.</p> <p><strong>7.8</strong>	You must only administer medicine from a monitored dosage system (MDS) if a pharmacist has prepared it and the tray or box is sealed and tamper-proof. You must not administer medicines from a tray or box that others – for example, relatives – have filled. This is because you cannot guarantee either the accuracy of the process for filling the tray or that contamination has not occurred.</p> <p><strong>7.9</strong>	You must not split a tablet – that is, to achieve the required dose – unless the manufacturer has scored the tablet and the pharmacist has given permission. If you do not have the correct dose to administer contact the pharmacist immediately and request the right dose tablets asap.</p> <p><strong>7.10</strong>	You must wash your hands before and after administering medicine. When applying creams, ointments, drops and handling a tablet (for example, because you need to split it) you must wear latex-free disposable gloves supplied by Tideway Care. You must wash your hands before putting the gloves on and again when you have taken them off. Dispose of them immediately following the <a href="/Policies/HS02.html">HS02 Infection Control Policy</a>.</p> <p><strong>7.11</strong>	It is best practice for a colleague to witness the administration of medication by initialing either a dedicated witness’s line on the Medication Administration Record Chart (MAR) (See section 17 record keeping) or dedicated witness sheet. However, we acknowledge that this will not always be possible. It is acceptable for the person we support to sign as the witness. However, they should only do this if the person writing their support plan has judged them reliable and detailed their role in their guidelines.</p> <p><strong>7.12</strong>	Medicines are the property of the person to whom they are prescribed. You must not give one person’s medicine to another person.</p> <h2 id="_8-when-required-prn-medicines"><a href="#_8-when-required-prn-medicines" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 8.	When Required (PRN) Medicines</h2> <p><strong>8.1</strong>	Health professionals usually prescribe medicine with a PRN dose for short term or intermittent medical conditions. So, it is unlikely that a person will need regular administrations of this type of medicine. It is very important that team members are familiar with the protocols around each prescription in order to prevent overdose.</p> <p><strong>8.2</strong>	To ensure team members give the medicine only as intended, you must obtain all relevant information from the person’s GP or supplying pharmacist and complete - Protocol for administering ‘when required’ (PRN) medicines.</p> <p><strong>8.3</strong>	You must record all administrations of PRN medicine on the person’s MAR chart. You must also record the exact time of administration and amount given on the MAR chart’s notes section. If the MAR chart does not have a notes section, then record using Medication notes for variable dose; ‘when required’ (PRN); refusals.</p> <p><strong>8.4</strong>	You must also use “Medication notes for variable dose; ‘when required’ (PRN)”; to record if the people we support refuse PRN medication if it is offered.</p> <p><strong>8.5</strong>	If you find that a person requires PRN medicine regularly, then you should assist them to request a review by the prescriber. This is because their condition may have changed and the treatment needs to change too. Similarly, if the medicine is not having the expected effect, you should report this to the prescriber.</p> <p><strong>8.6</strong>	Do not dispose of PRN medicines that are still in use and in date. Instead, carry over the quantity on to the new MAR chart and Medicine stock check if used. For instance, paracetamol is prescribed a PRN but not used very much so the stock remains high. Only dispose of it when it becomes out of date or the individual no longer requires it.</p> <h2 id="_9-covert-administration"><a href="#_9-covert-administration" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 9.	Covert Administration</h2> <p><strong>9.1</strong>	Covert administration (disguising medicines in food or drink) is generally not permitted.</p> <p>Medication is not deemed ‘covert’ if an individual requests that their medication is added to food or drink as they are fully aware. Remember, advice should be sought from the Pharmacist to ensure it is appropriate to mix the specific medication in the proposed food/drink to ensure the delivery method will not alter the uptake, dosing or efficacy of the medication</p> <p><strong>9.2</strong>	In exceptional circumstances, covert administration of medicines (may be necessary but is only lawful (in accordance with the Mental Capacity Act 2005) where the individual lacks capacity and it is in the individual’s best interest. Before covert administration of medicines can proceed, the Manager must have the written support of the multidisciplinary team. The best interest assessment and decision to administer medicines covertly should be clearly documented and a review date set.</p> <p><strong>9.3</strong>	Considerations for covert administration of medicines are as follows:</p> <ul><li>The individual’s best interests are considered at all times.</li> <li>The medication is essential for the individual’s health and well-being</li> <li>The decision to administer a medicine covertly should be a contingency measure after an assessment of the individual
Carers, relatives and the multidisciplinary team (including the prescriber and pharmacist) should be involved in the decision</li> <li>The method of administration should be agreed with the GP and pharmacist</li></ul> <p><strong>9.4</strong>	The decision, action taken, and details of all parties concerned should be documented in the support plan and reviewed at appropriate intervals. The process for covert administration is as follows:</p> <ul><li>An assessment of the person’s mental capacity should be undertaken in order to make a specific decision about their medicines</li> <li>The Manager should seek advice from the prescriber about other options e.g. whether the medicine could be stopped</li> <li>A best interest meeting must be held to agree whether giving medicines covertly is in the person’s best interest</li> <li>The Manager must record any decisions and state who was involved with the decision making process</li> <li>The Manager must agree where the records of decision are kept and who has access</li> <li>The Manager must seek advice from the Pharmacist to plan how the medicines can be given covertly</li> <li>The GP must provide authorisation and the Manager must provide clear instructions in the support plan.</li> <li>The Manager must ensure the staff are trained and assessed as competent to give the medicine covertly</li> <li>The Manager must set a date to review the decision to give medicines covertly</li> <li>It is good practice to get the person(s) involved to sign the MAR chart to endorse the decision made</li></ul> <h2 id="_10-homely-remedies-non-prescribed-medicines"><a href="#_10-homely-remedies-non-prescribed-medicines" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 10.	Homely Remedies (non-prescribed) Medicines</h2> <p><strong>10.1</strong>	Homely medicines are any medicine bought over the counter – for example, for pain relief, colds and indigestion. They include moisturising creams and ointments and complementary or alternative medicines such as herbal and traditional Chinese medicines.</p> <p><strong>10.2</strong>	Anybody has the right to purchase homely medicines. However, there is a risk that they will interact with prescribed medicines or prove inappropriate for some other reason. If a person we support, or their representative wants you to administer such a medicine you must seek advice from a pharmacist. If a pharmacist is not available, then seek advice from a doctor. If a doctor is not available, then speak to a nurse.</p> <p><strong>10.3</strong>	You must keep a list of pharmacist/GP-agreed conditions treatable with homely medicines in the person’s support plan.</p> <p><strong>10.4</strong>	You should advise any relative or friend likely to administer homely medicines to a person we support to administer only those medicines on the pharmacist/GP-agreed list. You should also encourage them to tell team members whenever they have administered homely medicines.</p> <p><strong>10.5</strong>	You must record administrations of homely medicine on either the person’s usual Medication administration record chart. Additionally, you must keep a register of homely medicines you store in the service. This register must be bound and hardback with numbered pages and every person must have a separate page for each homely medicine. In this register, you must record:</p> <ul><li>receipt of all homely medicines</li> <li>the quantity left after each administration</li> <li>the disposal of any homely medicine</li></ul> <p><strong>10.6</strong>	For supporting people with their creams / emollients; the person’s support plan will include their moisturising regime guidelines and staff are required to record applications accordingly.</p> <h2 id="_11-controlled-drugs"><a href="#_11-controlled-drugs" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 11.	Controlled Drugs</h2> <p><strong>11.1</strong>	Controlled drugs (CDs) are prescribed medicines usually used to treat severe pain, drug dependence, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and to induce anaesthesia. However, some people misuse and abuse controlled drugs by taking them when there is no clinical reason to do so. For this reason, they fall under Misuse of Drugs legislation.</p> <p><strong>11.2</strong>	The Misuse of Drugs Regulations classify controlled drugs by schedule. Schedule 1 has the highest level of control; schedule 5 has the least. All schedule 2 and some schedule 3 drugs – for example, temazepam, flunitrazepam, buprenorphine, dimethylpropane – are subject to safe custody, record-keeping and destruction requirements as described below.</p> <p><strong>11.3</strong>	Midazolam is a schedule 3 controlled drug prescribed to many of the people we support as PRN for epilepsy. This drug is exempt from the safe custody requirements described below. Refer to section 9 regarding safe storage.</p> <p><strong>11.4</strong>	If you are responsible for a person’s medication in a registered care home, you must store drugs that are subject to Safe Custody regulations in a cabinet or safe that meets BS2881:1989 level one standards. In brief, this means the cabinet must be:</p> <ul><li>locked with a key or digital lock</li> <li>made of metal with suitable hinges</li> <li>fixed to a suitably strong wall or floor with rag bolts that are not accessible from outside the cabinet</li> <li>located in a place where it will not attract the attention of passers-by</li></ul> <p>You must not store anything other than controlled drugs in a controlled drug cabinet; i.e. other medications must be stored separately. In their own homes, people may store controlled drugs if risk assessed as safe, but they must have a lockable drawer or tin in their designated safe room; e.g. bathroom or bedroom where guests do not frequently enter.</p> <p><strong>11.5</strong>	In every other setting, if the Tideway Care service has responsibility for safe-keeping controlled drugs, you must follow the storage guidance above as far as possible. It is especially important that you thoroughly risk assess the storage arrangements for all people we support.</p> <p><strong>11.6</strong>	It is also especially important to store controlled drugs according to their storage instructions. So, you must include any specific storage guidelines in the person’s support plan. And you must not allow excess stock to build up.</p> <p><strong>11.7</strong>	If you play any role in obtaining, storing, administering or destroying a controlled drug, you must keep a controlled drugs register. This register must be bound and hardback. You must keep a separate page for every form and different strength of drug stored. And on each page, you must record: the name and address of the pharmacy/GP/ hospital where you obtained:</p> <ul><li>the drug</li> <li>the date you obtained the drug</li> <li>the quantity you obtained</li> <li>a running balance (that is, you must update immediately after every administration)</li> <li>any disposal of the drug</li></ul> <p>You must sign all entries and, if possible, have a colleague sign as a witness.</p> <p><strong>11.8</strong>	If you risk assess that it is safe for a person to store a controlled drug in their bedroom, you should keep a record of the drugs they self-store in addition to the register described above.</p> <p><strong>11.9</strong>	If you collect schedule 2 or 3 controlled drug medicines on behalf of a person we support, the pharmacist will require proof of identity. So, you must produce your Tideway Care identity card. Additionally, the pharmacist will expect you to sign the back of the prescription. IN addition, the pharmacists may require the staff members address which can be the office base address for supported living services and the home address for the residential services.</p> <p><strong>11.10</strong>	When returning controlled drugs to the pharmacist, you must keep them separate from other medicines.</p> <p><strong>11.11</strong>	If you discover a discrepancy between the expected and actual quantity of a controlled drug in stock, you must immediately report it to the on-call manager.
You must also report the discrepancy on an incident/accident form. (The only exception to this rule is the sort of small unavoidable liquid- form medicine discrepancy.) Managers must investigate the discrepancy as soon as possible. In addition, check with the pharmacy too as a record of supply is made and a cabinet reconciliation could identify shortfalls or excesses at the point of dispensing.</p> <p><strong>11.12</strong>	If you find that a discrepancy is due to an error of subtraction or addition in the calculation of the balance, do not change the controlled drug register’s balance column or use correction fluid. Instead, under the last entry, record:</p> <ul><li>the date</li> <li>the error in subtraction/addition (indicated with an asterisk)</li> <li>the correct balance.</li> <li>Any narrative as to why this has happened</li></ul> <p>Initial the entry and have a colleague sign as witness</p> <p><strong>11.13</strong>	If you have reason to believe that the discrepancy is not an error of subtraction or addition and a quantity of the drug is missing, you must treat the incident as serious. This means reporting the incident to your Team lead, controlled drugs accountable officer (CDAO) and may mean involving the police.</p> <p><strong>11.14</strong>	For errors in the administration of a controlled drug, the consequences for the person involved are likely to be more serious than they would be for a non-controlled drug. So, in the event of an error, follow the procedure set out in the Incident Policy.</p> <p>You must contact a health professional for advice as soon as possible. You must also report the incident to the Team Manager and Operations Director immediately. They will decide who will report the incident to the CDAO as this is a statutory requirement.</p> <p><strong>11.15</strong>	All managers will be familiar with the controlled drugs local intelligence network (CD LINs) in their local area, and you will follow their procedure for reporting controlled drug concerns and errors to the area team lead controlled drugs accountable officer (CDAO).</p> <h2 id="_12-anti-coagulants-e-g-warfarin"><a href="#_12-anti-coagulants-e-g-warfarin" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 12. Anti-Coagulants, e.g. Warfarin</h2> <p><strong>12.1</strong>	People prescribed an anticoagulant drug such as warfarin must have an Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Pack (sometimes called ‘the yellow book’). The Anticoagulant Therapy Clinic uses this to record blood tests (called International Normalised Ratio (INR) tests) and dosage instructions.</p> <p><strong>12.2</strong>	When supporting a person in the administration of warfarin, this should include supporting them to attend their blood tests as directed by the clinic. So, you will need to refer to their Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Pack.</p> <p><strong>12.3</strong>	Prescribed doses of warfarin are often variable, which naturally increases the risk of error. So, you must assess the risk of administering a wrong dosage. In this risk assessment, you must include:</p> <ul><li>the implications of administering a wrong dose</li> <li>actions taken to mitigate the risk</li> <li>actions to take should anyone administer a wrong dose.</li></ul> <p><strong>12.4</strong>	When a dose changes, where possible you should have the health professional update the MAR chart. For guidance on amending the MAR chart yourself.</p> <p><strong>12.5</strong>	If you administer warfarin, you must be familiar with the different colours of the varying strengths of warfarin tablets. This is because different colours (strengths) may be required to make up a dose.</p> <ul><li>0.5mg – White</li> <li>1mg Brown</li> <li>3mg Blue</li> <li>5mg Pink</li></ul> <p><strong>12.6</strong>	You must develop procedures to ensure that all team members know: the results of a person’s most recent INR how to follow up with the clinic if the person has not received their results within three days of their last blood test.</p> <h2 id="_13-level-3-administration-by-specialist-technique"><a href="#_13-level-3-administration-by-specialist-technique" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 13.	Level 3: Administration by specialist technique</h2> <p><strong>13.1</strong> <strong>Delegated nursing tasks:</strong> Level 3 ‘administrations by specialist technique’ are normally performed by a healthcare professional. This is usually the community nurse. However, the health care professional may delegate such tasks to support workers, hence the phrase ‘delegated nursing task’.</p> <p><strong>13.2</strong>	Where agreed by the relevant health professional and person we support, our team members will perform a delegated task, managers are responsible for arranging training for team members.</p> <p><strong>13.3</strong>	Before you perform a delegated nursing task, the relevant health professional must train you, and this training must be person-specific as opposed to task-specific. So, if you support two people to be percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy (PEG) fed, they must train you twice. They must also sign you off as competent. If you cannot evidence that the health professional considers you competent, then you must not perform the task.</p> <p><strong>13.4</strong>	The delegating health professional remains ultimately responsible for tasks they have delegated. In addition to confirming in writing which team members are competent to perform the task they must provide details on refresher requirements and ensure these are met.</p> <p><strong>13.5</strong>	The Programme Coach should keep evidence of both team members’ competence and refresher details in the C3 Administration of medication file. Additionally, as a manager you must keep your team members and services’ records up to date.</p> <p><strong>13.6</strong>	Before you perform a delegated nursing task for a person, you must have their permission. So, if you or the delegating health professional assesses the person as lacking capacity to make this decision, you must follow a best interest process before agreeing to perform the task.</p> <h2 id="_14-recording-keeping"><a href="#_14-recording-keeping" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 14.	Recording keeping</h2> <p><strong>14.1</strong>	Team Managers are responsible for maintaining appropriate medication records for their services. Team members are responsible for completing records as required.</p> <p><strong>14.2</strong>	A person’s medication records are private and their own. The new GDPR requires the storing and sharing of sensitive information to be an absolute minimum. However, there will be occasions when you need to share such information about people we support – with, for example, health professionals, other social care professionals and relatives or advocates. We will request all the people we support or their advocate to sign a consent to share form. The Health and Social Care Information Centre has set out five rules to help us understand when it is acceptable to share such information and how to do it:</p> <ul><li>Confidential information about service users or patients should be treated confidentially and respectfully</li> <li>Members of a care team should share confidential information when it is needed for the safe and effective care of an individual</li> <li>Information that is shared for the benefit of the community should be anonymised</li> <li>An individual’s right to object to the sharing of confidential information about them should be respected.</li> <li>Organisations should put policies, procedures and systems in place to ensure the confidentiality rules are followed.</li> <li>A guide to confidentiality in health and social care, 2013 See the Records policy and Joint working policy.</li></ul> <p><strong>14.3</strong>	When you transfer a person’s support to another provider and you have been responsible for managing their medication, you must share all information about their medicines. Likewise, when taking on a person’s support from another provider whose medication you will be managing, you should ensure that you receive all relevant information from the outgoing provider. Check the people we support have consented to this.</p> <p><strong>14.4</strong>	As a manager, you must keep a record of each team member’s signature and self-written initials for matching purposes. You should keep this in the C3 Administration of medication file.</p> <p><strong>14.5</strong>	There is no requirement to record level 1 general support tasks on a MAR charts, but please enter details on daily notes.</p> <p><strong>14.6</strong>	You must record all level 2 and 3 administrations of medicine on an appropriate MAR chart with reference to the key. (For descriptions of level 2 &amp; 3 tasks, see paragraph 2.1). If a person self-medicates some medicines but you administer others, you should include the items they self-medicate on their MAR chart but write ‘Self-medicating’ next to them.</p> <p><strong>14.7</strong>	If the person’s dispensing pharmacy provides a MAR chart, use this. (It may be necessary to request one.)</p> <p><strong>14.8</strong>	If the pharmacy does not provide a MAR chart, use the Tideway Care Medication administration record. If using this chart, you will need to enter the person’s details and medication details yourself. Only do this once you have received or collected the medicine. Check the medicine label against the prescription, then copy the details on to the MAR chart exactly as they appear on the medicine’s label – for example: RAMIPRIL 1.25MG CAPS ONE to be taken DAILY.</p> <p><strong>14.9</strong>	If completing the form by hand, take care to print this information clearly in black ink. Complete all other relevant fields, too – 'Quantity received’, ‘Medication administration times (MAT)’ and so on – and initial to evidence that you have done this.  Do the same when returning medicines.</p> <p><strong>14.10</strong>	When a health professional prescribes a medicine that does not feature on the person’s usual pharmacy-supplied MAR chart – for example, antibiotics for an infection use Medication administration record. When completing, follow directions in paragraph 4.6. If possible, replace this MAR chart with an updated pharmacist’s version at the earliest opportunity but retain the temporary MAR chart, keeping it in the C3 Administration section of the medication file with the usual MAR chart. You must add the medicine and administration guidelines to the person’s support plan. To ensure that colleagues are aware, you must direct them to these amendments using either the service’s communication book or the person’s daily records.</p> <p><strong>14.11</strong>	If the person’s MAR chart does not include fields for checking medicines into the service or you do not administer their medicine but you are collecting or receiving it on their behalf, you must complete a collecting or receiving medicines record to evidence receipt. You should keep this in the C3 Administration section of medication file.</p> <p><strong>14.12</strong>	When checking in, returning or disposing of medicines, if possible a colleague must witness and initial the relevant MAR chart or form to evidence that they have observed you do this correctly.</p> <p><strong>14.13</strong>	You must retain all written correspondence about a person’s medication. You should keep such correspondence in the person’s A3 Medical file. Verbal orders &amp; amending a MAR chart.</p> <p><strong>14.14</strong>	You should only accept verbal orders to stop giving medicines or amend doses when the person’s health would be at risk if you did not follow the order.</p> <p><strong>14.15</strong>	In such a circumstance, if possible, the prescriber should amend the MAR chart, signing and dating the changes.</p> <p><strong>14.16</strong>	If the prescriber cannot amend the MAR chart – for example, because they are instructing you by phone – you will need to amend the MAR chart yourself, following these instructions:</p> <ul><li>neatly cross through the changed information but leave it legible</li> <li>neatly add the new information</li> <li>date and initial the change</li> <li>explain in the notes section of the MAR chart or on Medication notes for variable dose; ‘when required’ (PRN);</li> <li>reasons why the item was changed, giving the time and date of the change and the prescriber’s name.</li></ul> <p>It is good practice to:</p> <ul><li>repeat the instructions back to the prescriber to confirm you have heard them correctly</li> <li>ask the prescriber to spell any difficult words</li> <li>have a witness confirm the information.</li></ul> <p><strong>14.17</strong>	You should obtain written confirmation from the prescriber within 24 hours of their making the change. You or the prescriber should share this written confirmation with the pharmacist as soon as possible so they may amend the MAR chart.</p> <p><strong>14.18</strong>	When administering liquid medicine, it is likely that small inevitable errors will cause a discrepancy in the calculated balance of remaining liquid. For example, if a 200ml bottle of liquid is dispensed and the prescription requires a twice-daily administration of 5ml, the bottle should theoretically last 20 days, and at the start of the 20th day you would expect 10ml to remain. However, the cumulative effect of small inaccuracies over the past 19 days might mean there is less. You must record such instances on the Medicines stock check form, but do not carry over errors from one bottle to the next. This means recording the new amount when opening a new bottle.</p> <p><strong>14.19</strong> <strong>When a person is away from the service:</strong> You must make a record of any medicines taken from the service, using a Medicine leaving the service record. If you are handing medicine over to another person – for example, somebody’s relative – as well as initialling the record yourself, you should ask that person to sign it. Use the same sheet to evidence the return of any medicine, and ask the person returning the medicine to sign it.</p> <p><strong>14.20</strong>	If the person is away from the service and somebody other than a Tideway Care team member is responsible for administering their medicine – for example, a relative – you must not give them the original MAR chart. If the responsible person wishes, you may give them a photocopy to use. But you should continue to complete the original MAR sheet as directed in the key – for example, using the letter ‘A’ to signify their absence.</p> <p><strong>14.21</strong>	If the person is going to be away from the service but you are still responsible for administering their medication – for example, on a day trip – you must not take the original MAR chart. This is to safeguard against its loss. Instead, either take a photocopied version or draw a form up especially. Sign the photocopied version or especially drawn-up form in the usual way, and dispose of it only once you have signed the original on return to the service.</p> <p><strong>14.22</strong> <strong>Document retention:</strong> Other than Medication leaving the service you must retain records for a minimum of three years. However, be aware that your local authority may require you to keep them for longer.</p> <p><strong>14.23</strong>	Until you dispose of the medicine, you must keep the patient information leaflets for each medicine the pharmacy supplies. You must also allow the person concerned access to these leaflets.</p> <p><strong>14.24</strong> <strong>Refusals:</strong> Managers are responsible for ensuring that team members are familiar with the procedures for dealing with refusals. They are also responsible for reporting refusals to relevant outside agencies and requesting mental capacity assessments and best interest meetings where relevant. Once familiarised with these systems, team members are responsible for their own actions.</p> <p><strong>14.25</strong>	If a person with capacity refuses their medicine, you must respect their decision. However, you should be aware of any guidance in their support plan around refusals – for example, offering to administer again after a specified length of time. You must also:</p> <ul><li>record the refusal on their MAR chart as directed in the key</li> <li>record the reason for their refusal in the MAR chart’s notes section or on their Medication notes for variable dose; ‘when required’ (PRN); refusals</li> <li>seek advice on further action from the prescriber as soon as possible.</li></ul> <p><strong>14.26</strong>	If a person repeatedly refuses their medicine, try to understand why. For example, would they prefer it in a different form – liquid instead of tablet maybe? Support them to inform the prescriber and to resolve the situation as soon as possible.</p> <p><strong>14.27</strong>	If you suspect a person lacks the capacity to understand the consequences of their refusal, you must inform the prescriber. They should then conduct a mental capacity assessment, involving all relevant people – relatives, care management, the support team and so on – in making a best interest decision on the person’s behalf. (See <a href="/Policies/OP07.html">OP07 - Mental Capacity Act</a>)</p> <p><strong>14.28</strong>	Whether a person has mental capacity or not, you must never administer medicines without the person knowing or attempt to make the medicine palatable in any way unless agreed by their pharmacist and prescriber as part of a best interest decision.</p> <h2 id="_15-errors-and-incident-reporting"><a href="#_15-errors-and-incident-reporting" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 15.	Errors and Incident Reporting</h2> <p><strong>15.1</strong>	Managers are responsible for ensuring that team members are familiar with procedures for dealing with medication errors; also for implementing error-reduction measures particular to their service; investigating errors, making judgments depending on the findings of investigations and taking appropriate action to reduce the chances of recurrence. It is also their responsibility to inform other relevant stakeholders of an error.</p> <p><strong>15.2</strong>	Medication errors include:</p> <ul><li>giving the wrong medication</li> <li>giving the wrong dose</li> <li>administering via the wrong route</li> <li>administering medication at the wrong time</li> <li>neglecting to administer</li> <li>failing to sign for medication that has been administered</li></ul> <p><strong>15.3</strong>	As the person who has made the error, you must not administer any more medication until your line manager has investigated the incident and given permission. The only exception to this rule is when not administering further medication compromises the immediate needs of people we support – for example, because you are lone-working and no colleague is available to take over.</p> <p><strong>15.4</strong>	Because we have a duty of candour to the people we support, you must tell the person concerned what happened. Unless they specifically state that they do not want you to, you must also tell their relatives or advocate. If they do not want you to, you should ask them to complete the - Somebody is worried about you easy- read document to evidence this. You must also apologise for the error and offer them the opportunity to make a complaint. (Duty of Candour)</p> <p><strong>15.5</strong>	Local safeguarding teams have varying policy on reporting medication errors; either the report goes to the care management team or the local safeguarding team. All Team Managers and Programme Coaches must familiarise themselves with and follow the local authority’s protocols for error reporting.</p> <p><strong>15.6</strong>	Even if you are not routinely required to report medication errors to the local authority, you should consider whether the error warrants a safeguarding alert. When making that decision, it may help to ask the following questions:</p> <ul><li>is a particular person allegedly responsible because of something they did or did not do?</li> <li>was the incident due to a failure in care, a breach of policy and procedure or professional code of practice?</li> <li>has the person we support been, or do they appear to have been harmed, or is there a potential risk of significant harm to them or another person?</li></ul> <p><strong>15.7</strong>	The more of these questions you answer Yes to, the stronger our recommendation that you raise an alert. If you have any doubts as to whether you should report an incident, always seek advice. (See <a href="/Policies/OP01.html">OP01 -  Safeguarding Adults and Children</a>)</p> <p><strong>15.8</strong>	The Care Quality Commission (CQC) does not require notification of medication errors except in certain circumstances. These circumstances are:</p> <ul><li>the error is a contributing factor to either serious injury or death</li> <li>somebody suspects the error was deliberate and abusive</li> <li>the local safeguarding team is treating the error as abuse (this includes abuse through neglect).</li></ul> <p>In these circumstances, you must notify CQC using the relevant notification form ‘without delay’.</p> <p><strong>15.9</strong>	The registered manager must arrange a fact-finding investigation as soon as possible after the error’s detection.</p> <p><strong>15.10</strong>	Incidents may occur that we might more accurately describe as systemic failures or near misses than errors - for example, information printed wrongly on a MAR chart that somebody notices before an error occurs. You must report these internally using the online accident/incident reporting system in just the same way you would any other incident.  However, registered managers must rectify such failings immediately. Managers should also consider whether any team member has contributed to the incident and be prepared to take appropriate action when they have.</p> <p><strong>15.11</strong>	Because team members must demonstrate competence before administering medication, we do not treat errors for which they are responsible as a capability matter but a matter of misconduct.</p> <p><strong>15.12</strong>	If the investigation concludes that the offending team member has committed an act of gross misconduct, the case should be referred to the Disciplinary policy and advice from HR or the Operations Director should be sought as soon as possible. Generally, you should consider the following types of incident to be gross misconduct:</p> <ul><li>intentional harm of a person we support</li> <li>willful disobedience of a reasonable instruction</li> <li>deliberate disregard of a safety regulation or requirement</li> <li>putting a person we support at risk of harm</li></ul> <p><strong>15.13</strong>	If the investigation does not conclude that the actions constitutes gross misconduct and this is the team member’s first error, then the team member must undergo retraining and reassessment and issue an improvement note. If it is not their first error, then seek advice from your HR consultant. But you should be aware that generally:</p> <ul><li>where a team member fails to improve after we have issued an improvement note, we will issue a written warning</li> <li>where a team member fails to improve while a written warning is valid, we will issue a final written warning</li> <li>where a team member fails to improve while a final written warning is valid, we will dismiss (with notice)</li></ul> <p><strong>15.14</strong>	If you notice that a colleague has failed to sign for medicine that they should have administered, in the first instance check the stock. If the stocktake indicates that they did not administer the medicine, you must treat the incident as an error. If the stocktake indicates that they did administer the medicine, you must check with the team member. In this circumstance, if they are not at work, it is OK to call them at home. If they confirm that they did administer the medicine, you must communicate the incident to other colleagues – for example, by leaving a message in the communication book or attaching a post-it note to the MAR chart. As a team member who neglected to sign for medication you gave, you must sign for it at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p><strong>15.15</strong>	As a manager you must do all you can to reduce the chance of medication errors and the risks associated with them. Measures will differ from service to service, according, for example, to whether team members are able to conduct face-to-face handovers. However, where possible, to ensure that you spot errors as soon as possible, measures must include incoming team members evidencing that they have checked the MAR chart.</p> <h2 id="_16-adverse-reactions"><a href="#_16-adverse-reactions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 16.	Adverse reactions</h2> <p><strong>16.1</strong>	An adverse drug reaction is an unwanted or harmful reaction that you suspect or know is due to an administered drug.</p> <p><strong>16.2</strong>	A severe allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts to an allergen</p> <p><strong>16.3</strong>	An adverse effect is an unexpected and serious side effect of medication</p> <p><strong>16.4</strong>	A mild allergic reaction occurs when the immune system responds negatively to an allergen</p> <p><strong>16.5</strong>	A severe allergic reaction is known as anaphylaxis. <strong>Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction to a trigger such as an allergy</strong>.  It's also known as anaphylactic shock.</p> <p><strong>16.6</strong> <strong>Symptoms of anaphylaxis:</strong> Anaphylaxis usually develops suddenly and gets worse very quickly. The symptoms include:</p> <ul><li>feeling lightheaded or faint</li> <li>breathing difficulties – such as fast, shallow breathing</li> <li>wheezing</li> <li>a fast heartbeat</li> <li>clammy skin</li> <li>confusion and anxiety</li> <li>collapsing or losing consciousness</li> <li>There may also be other allergy symptoms, including an itchy, raised rash (hives), feeling or being sick, swelling (angioedema), or stomach pain.</li></ul> <p><strong>16.7</strong> <strong>What to do if someone has anaphylaxis?</strong> Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. It can be very serious if not treated quickly.  If someone has symptoms of anaphylaxis, you should:</p> <ul><li>use an adrenaline auto-injector if the person has one and if you have been trained to do so</li> <li>call 999 for an ambulance immediately (even if they start to feel better) – mention that you think the person has anaphylaxis</li> <li>remove any trigger if possible – for example, carefully remove any wasp or bee sting stuck in the skin</li> <li>lie the person down flat – unless they're unconscious, pregnant or having breathing difficulties</li> <li>give another injection after 5-15 minutes if the symptoms don't improve and a second auto-injector is available</li></ul> <p><strong>16.8</strong>	If you suspect that a person is suffering an adverse reaction to their medicine, you must follow the procedures in Adverse reaction flowchart</p> <p><img src="/images/AdverseReactionsFlowchart.png" alt="Adverse Reactions Flowchart" title="Adverse Reactions Flowchart"></p> <h2 id="_17-disposal-of-medicines"><a href="#_17-disposal-of-medicines" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 17.	Disposal of medicines</h2> <p><strong>17.1</strong>	Where people we support are not responsible for the safekeeping of their medicines, managers are responsible for disposal arrangements.</p> <p><strong>17.2</strong>	Medicines are the property of the person to whom the health professional has prescribed them. So, if you need to dispose of unwanted medicines on their behalf, you must evidence their consent or their advocate’s consent by using Appendix 13: Consent for destruction of unwanted medicines form. (Where the person or their advocate is unable to sign, the manager or assistant manager may do so.) The person receiving the medicines – that is, the pharmacist – must also sign this form, and, if possible, provide a receipt. This is to cover you if consent for disposal is disputed or somebody alleges that you have not disposed of the medicine correctly.</p> <p><strong>17.3</strong>	You must also record the disposal of any unwanted medicines’ on the person’s MAR chart.</p> <p><strong>17.4</strong>	You will need to dispose of medicines in Tideway Care’s safekeeping when:</p> <ul><li>a course of treatment is completed or discontinued</li> <li>the medicine has passed its expiry date</li> <li>the medicine is spoiled, for example by being dropped</li> <li>the medicine has not been administered, for example through error or</li> <li>refusal</li> <li>the person moves and does not wish to take the medicines with them</li> <li>the person dies</li></ul> <p><strong>17.5</strong>	Once identified as unwanted, you must clearly mark medicines as such and keep them apart from other medicines until you dispose of them. You must not take unwanted medicines into stock or administer them to other people.</p> <p><strong>17.6</strong>	You must not dispose of medicines by throwing them away or flushing them down the sink or toilet. You must dispose of them by returning them to the pharmacy.</p> <p><strong>17.7</strong>	It may not be practical to return a single contaminated or refused tablet to the pharmacy immediately after every incident. You may ask the pharmacist for an empty tablet bottle to keep wasted doses in. However, for reasons of toxicity you must not mix methotrexate with other medicines. Always return this medicine in its original packaging.</p> <p><strong>17.8</strong>	When a person dies, you must keep their medicines for seven days. This is because the Coroner’s office or courts may require them. In any case, after a person’s death their medicines become the property of the estate, so responsibility for their disposal passes to the executors. You will need to discuss the arrangements with them.</p> <p><strong>17.9</strong>	If you or visiting health professionals use syringes or needles in the service, you must obtain a rigid sharps box for their immediate disposal and abide by local clinical waste disposal arrangements. (See <a href="/Policies/HS02.html">HS02 - Infection control</a>)</p> <h2 id="_18-medication-audit"><a href="#_18-medication-audit" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 18.	Medication audit</h2> <p><strong>18.1</strong>	A medication audit is not just to check that there is a sufficient stock of medication. A medication audit also ensures that; MAR sheets have been completed accurately, the medication stock count has been completed, medicines received have been recorded correctly, medication is in date, medication is being stored safely and securely, team members have been trained correctly, changes in medication have been updated in the person we support’s protocol, PRN protocols are in place and up to date, medication has been ordered.</p> <p><strong>18.2</strong>	A delegated person must perform the checks detailed in the Enablement Leader Weekly Checks which is located in the person we support’s B folder (regulation and Inspection).</p> <p><strong>18.3</strong>	You must check that the amounts of medication in stock are correct on at least a weekly basis using the Medicine stock check. This includes homely, PRN medicines and controlled drugs (see relevant sections within 3. Administering medicines for specific guidance). However, it excludes blister-packed medicines and medicines dispensed from sealed dosage pots. This is because it should be obvious when administering that medicines dispensed in this way are missing. You should keep completed Medicines stock check sheets in the C3 Administration of medication file.</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <p><a href="/Policies/OP12Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - Glossary of Terms</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP12Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - NICE Commonly Prescribed Controlled Drugs</a></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/8/2018, 3:38:46 PM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
