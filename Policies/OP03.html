At Tideway Care we have a responsibility to report such incidents. Our strategy is always to prevent harmful incidents, however; should they arise we will respond quickly and efficiently to seek improvements and mitigate against reoccurrence.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	The reporting and monitoring of incidents of actual or potential harm assists us to identify organisational, governance and service developments through rigorous review and investigation.

What is an Incident</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong> <strong>The World Health Organisation defines reportable incidents as</strong>:
<strong>‘Incident’</strong> – an event or circumstance that could have, or did result, in unnecessary damage, loss or harm such as physical or mental injury to a patient, staff, visitors or members of the public.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	An <strong>incident</strong> is something that has occurred; in the context of this policy we want people to report any incident that has the potential to cause harm or harm or damage has happened. A <strong>serious incident</strong> is where the harm is graded as medium to high and it is more permanent and has significant impact. We have detailed some examples of incident grading and serious incidents in <a href="/Policies/OP03Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 – Categorisation of Serious Incidents</a>.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	A <strong>Near Miss</strong> is an incident that had the potential to cause harm but did not at this time. This might be wrong medication being offered someone and the person we support tells you rightly it is the wrong tablet. The tablet is not given but it might have been harmful if the person being supported hadn’t noticed the error and it had been given.</p> <p>3.4	Each incident will need to be categorised and the level of reporting required identified at the earliest opportunity. As a rule of thumb, always report to your line manager or supervisor as soon as possible within 24 hours of the incident occurring or having been brought to your attention.</p> <p>3.5	If in any doubt but you have a ‘gut feeling’ talk to your line manager or supervisor as soon as possible.</p> <h2 id="_4-initial-actions"><a href="#_4-initial-actions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Initial Actions</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	Safety is the first priority for any incident or near misses – ensure all people involved are out of harm's way.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	Support for people involved following the incident to be provided immediately after the incident but also some time later when the impact and emotional responses can emerge after the initial shock. Put a plan in place to ensure support is available in response to the incident as required.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	Document the detail of the incident as required by the Tideway guidance- as a minimum complete the incident details on the Tideway Care Incident system.</p> <h2 id="_5-follow-up-actions"><a href="#_5-follow-up-actions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Follow Up Actions</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	Review incident with the team to identify any further actions required and report any concerns to relevant people. See <a href="/Policies/OP03.html#_7-when-and-how-to-notify-other-people-about-incidents">section 7</a>.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	Talk to the person/s we support if incident impacts on them and talk to their family if people we support agrees or if family are designated as carers and part of the team.
