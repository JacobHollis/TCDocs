Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	This policy highlights our obligations and responsibilities as an employer and also sets the culture of the organisation underpinned by our values:</p> <ul><li>Striving passionately to be the best and not afraid to challenge the norm</li> <li>Always treating people how we would want to be treated ourselves</li> <li>Focussing on the positive, finding silver linings and never giving up</li></ul> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	Tideway Care hold our staff in great esteem as our most valuable resource and assets and will encourage our staff to be involved and accountable for the success of our corporate vision.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	We want to ensure that our staff are able to achieve and aspire within their workplace and work with compassion, excitement and joy.</p> <h2 id="_2-probationary-period"><a href="#_2-probationary-period" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Probationary Period</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	All employees will be required to complete a probationary period prior to a permanent contract of employment being signed off. This period allows both employer and employee to find out whether the appointment meets their expectations. Tideway care probationary period is 6 months with formal reviews at three months and at six months post start date. See <a href="/Policies/HR01Appendix01.html">Appendix 1</a> for flow chart</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	Within the induction period the staff member will have a 1-1 meeting with their line manager to discuss their Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and agree OKRs for the 3 months ahead. They will also agree any additional support needs the staff member may have and agree how these will be met.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong> <strong>3 month formal review</strong> - 3-month reviews should be arranged as near to 3-months after the start date as possible. Together we will review the OKRs and also seek feedback from the staff member’s work colleagues and the people they support. The line manager and member of staff will agree OKRs for the next 3-months and put plans in place to support their goals and personal development plans. If there are significant performance issues the line manager may decide at this point to fail the member of staff’s probation which will lead to the employment being terminated.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong> <strong>6 month formal review</strong> - This review will have a similar format to the 3 month review (See Form X). If both the line manager and member of staff are happy about how things are going the probation can be considered as passed and the member of staff will be converted to a permanent employee. At this point they will begin setting OKRs as part of the full staff appraisal system, to be reviewed every 6 months.  If, however the line manager is unsatisfied with performance, they may elect to fail the probation period or extend it for another three months.</p> <h2 id="_3-staff-support-wellbeing-training-appraisal-supervision"><a href="#_3-staff-support-wellbeing-training-appraisal-supervision" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Staff Support - Wellbeing, Training, Appraisal &amp; Supervision</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	Staff wellbeing is important to Tideway Care; our wellbeing initiatives include:</p> <ul><li><strong>Recognition and Reward</strong>: Employee of the month / Annual awards</li> <li><strong>Keeping Healthy</strong>: Health promotion events / Healthy lifestyles at work</li> <li><strong>Making a Difference Days</strong>: Volunteering for the day / Fundraising for charities</li></ul> <p><strong>3.2</strong> <strong>Appraisal</strong>: Our appraisal system is detailed in Appendix 2 as a cycle of co-producing a work plan and personal development plan for each member of the Tideway Care Team. It reflects on previous achievements and looks at areas for development and training needs.  This is our ADORE cycle:</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">This is our ADORE cycle:</p> <p><strong>A</strong>ppraise: Review OKRs every 3 months and assess how we performed<br> <strong>D</strong>evelopment Needs Reflection: Reflecting on whether we met the development needs<br> <strong>O</strong>bjectives and Key Results Setting: Agreeing the next set of OKRs<br> <strong>R</strong>eaching for the Stars: Looking at stretching ourselves and going the extra mile<br> <strong>E</strong>ngagement: Agreeing how we work together to achieve the results we want</p></div> <p><strong>3.3</strong> <strong>Learning</strong>: Tideway cares aspires to be a learning organisation, we seek to acquire more knowledge and skills relating to the delivery of excellence in our service provision. We will learn from experience, from when things go well and when they do not. We will support our staff through sharing learning throughout the organisation whether it has been sourced internally or externally by others.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong> <strong>Development</strong>: Tideway intends to grow as an organisation not only in size but in scope; the depth and breadth of development will be related to how we invest in helping our staff grow and evolve. We will seek out development opportunities which will build confidence and competence. We will encourage people not to be self-limiting and to have aspirations.</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong> <strong>Induction Training</strong>: Our induction training includes a welcome to Tideway Care, what we stand for, our vision, values and aspirations, our team, our systems and our processes. It will include a section on how to guidance and also our specific approaches for supporting our people.</p> <p><strong>3.6</strong> <strong>Essential Training</strong>:  Based on an individual’s roles and responsibilities a programme of essential training will be produced to ensure they are able to deliver safe, sound and supportive care whilst embedding our values into everything we do. This programme will be informative, interactive and ongoing. We believe that training is only embedded when followed up by coaching, reviewing, developing and experiencing learning into practice.</p> <p><strong>3.7</strong> <strong>Developmental Training</strong>: Through appraisal system we will work with our staff to identify further training opportunities that will support their growth and development and the needs of the people we care for.</p> <p><strong>3.8</strong> <strong>Management Supervision</strong>: This is line management supervision which will be focussed on OKRs and any performance concerns. This is undertaken monthly as a minimum with your line manager and must be recorded using the supervision system.</p> <p><strong>3.9</strong> <strong>Practice Support</strong><br>
In addition to time with line managers the following are ways in which the organisation seeks to provide support to staff;</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Practice supervision</strong> - This is to focus on your interactions with the people we support and their families to explore ways in working with them to improve outcomes. It is undertaken with a PBS Practitioner and will occur weekly.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Reflective practice</strong> - Reflective practice is about taking time either individually or in a group to think and review what has occurred and consider whether things could have been different if you or the environment had been different. This is useful after an incident or a complaint has been made or to work through a scenario that has not gone well or one that has gone very well to clarify lessons learnt.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Informal supervision</strong> - This is when you seek some advice or want to check something out with a peer or line manager. It is not documented or recorded in anyway but provides you with support. Sometimes this can be just before leaving a shift and you want to talk about an incident that has occurred before you leave.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="_4-whistleblowing"><a href="#_4-whistleblowing" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Whistleblowing</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	We aspire to have an open and transparent culture where everyone feels they can raise concerns and complaints without fear of reprisal. This is one of the ways we will learn and develop to be the best we can be. Whistleblowing is one of the ways people may want to feedback concerns.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	The legal framework for whistleblowing says that it is defined by the reporting of a wrongdoing that is disclosed because it is in the best interests of the public. It is a way in which concerns can be raised anonymously with an expectation that it will be responded to.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	Whistleblowing can be made by completing the whistleblowing form on the staff SharePoint site or by phoning the number listed on the whistleblowing poster (<a href="/Policies/HR01Appendix05.html">Appendix 5</a>). The person raising the concern / making the disclosure will not be subject to any prejudicial treatment as a result of being a whistle-blower.</p> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	The Senior Management Team will appoint an appropriate person to investigate the concerns either through the complaints process or in accordance with the section 7 of the Employment policy if the concern is a grievance against one or more members of staff or via safeguarding processes if there is an indication of potential or actual harm.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong>	If the whistle-blower is anonymous they cannot receive personal feedback on the outcome of investigating the concerns; however, in the spirit of transparency and our duty of candour we will share the details of the disclosure, the actions taken, and the subsequent actions required in response to an investigation unless it is a grievance which is a confidential process.</p> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	When the whistle-blower makes themselves known; they will be supported to meet with a nominated person to manage the disclosure to discuss in more details their concerns. Together they will agree the best way of dealing with the concerns and agree timeframes for completion. If mediation is required or an advocate present; these will be facilitated.</p> <p><strong>4.7</strong>	The details and outcome of the whistleblowing incident will be recorded on the whistleblowing log. Learnings and actions taken from the whistleblowing log will be shared amongst the relevant teams without disclosing sensitive information.</p> <p><strong>4.8</strong>	The whistleblowing process must be made clear to all staff and visitors (see <a href="/Policies/HR01Appendix05.html">Appendix 5</a> for poster)</p> <h2 id="_5-grievance-bullying-and-harassment-procedure"><a href="#_5-grievance-bullying-and-harassment-procedure" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Grievance, Bullying and Harassment Procedure</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	Tideway Care will foster a culture of mutual respect and positivity towards others. Our staff should be able to come to work without fear of bullying, harassment or unfair treatment. Bullying and harassment are defined by how an individual perceives the way they are treated, not always by the intentions of those around them. It is important for us to recognise how people feel and try to treat everyone the way they wish to be treated.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	Bullying and harassment is behaviour that makes someone feel intimidated or offended. Harassment is unlawful under the Equality Act 2010.  Examples of bullying or harassing behaviour include but are not limited to:</p> <ul><li>spreading malicious rumours, or insulting someone by word or behaviour</li> <li>copying memos that are critical about someone to others who do not need to know</li> <li>ridiculing or demeaning someone – picking on them or setting them up to fail</li> <li>exclusion or victimisation</li> <li>unfair treatment</li> <li>overbearing supervision or other misuse of power or position</li> <li>unwelcome sexual advances – touching, standing too close, display of offensive materials, asking for sexual favours, making decisions on the basis of sexual advances being accepted or rejected</li> <li>making threats or comments about job security without foundation</li> <li>deliberately undermining a competent worker by overloading and constant criticism</li> <li>preventing individuals progressing by intentionally blocking promotion or training opportunities.</li></ul> <p>Bullying and harassment can happen:</p> <ul><li>face-to-face</li> <li>by letter</li> <li>by email</li> <li>by phone</li> <li>on social media</li></ul> <p><strong>5.3</strong> <strong>Reporting</strong>: If someone is making you feel uncomfortable, unfairly treated, intimidated or is behaving in an offensive manner towards you, please report any concerns to your line manager.  If your concern is either about your manager or you are unable / do not want to tell them for some other reason, please feel free to speak to any member of the Senior Management Team. Anything you say will be treated in strict confidence and your concerns will not be shared with anyone without consulting you first.</p> <p><strong>5.4</strong> <strong>Formalising a Grievance</strong>: The manager/ SMT member will discuss your concerns with you and attempt to help you to resolve the situation. They will offer you the opportunity to make a formal grievance, which if you accept can be filed by completing a grievance report form together.</p> <p><strong>5.5</strong> <strong>Response</strong>:  A confidential meeting with you will be held between you and a manager to ask you about your concerns and counselling offered as appropriate within 48 hours of reporting. You will be able to bring a supporter with you; this can be anyone you like who will be there to support, advocate on your behalf and help you through the meeting. It is better to choose someone who is not a witness as they may be interviewed themselves.</p> <ul><li><p>The investigating manager will arrange a meeting with the individual(s) you have made a grievance about. The individual will have the right to bring a supporter with them to this meeting.</p></li> <li><p>Any witnesses to the events in question may also be interviewed to find out what they think has happened.</p></li> <li><p>The manager / SMT member will then document any meetings that have occurred and complete their findings in a grievance investigation form. This should be completed within 10 working days of the original grievance report.</p></li> <li><p>This form will be reviewed by the Operations Director to decide next steps this may include further interviews to be conducted to clarify a point or it will result in a decision on whether there is a case to answer or not.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>5.6</strong> <strong>React</strong>: When all the facts are clarified the following actions may be taken:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Disciplinary Action</strong> – In cases where there is clear evidence of wrongdoing, particularly where it is judged to have been intentional or malicious in nature.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mediation</strong> – In cases where there is some form of misunderstanding where the parties involved may be able to amicably resolve the issue.</p></li> <li><p><strong>No Action</strong> – Where there is no evidence to support further action. Attempts should be made to ensure both parties are satisfied with the outcome of the investigation and are supported to continue working</p></li></ul> <p><strong>5.7</strong> <strong>Right to Appeal</strong>: should the outcome of the investigation into concerns raised be felt to be unsatisfactory, the employee has the right to appeal and can do this in writing to the Managing Director or seek advice from ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service).</p> <p><strong>5.8</strong> <strong>Review</strong>: An anonymised summary of any reported grievances will be reviewed by the Senior Management Team (SMT) on a monthly basis to understand any actions required at an organisational level and identify any emerging themes that need addressing.</p> <h2 id="_6-performance-management"><a href="#_6-performance-management" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Performance Management</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	Performance is about accomplishing what you set out to do; we want our staff to perform to their best and be proud of what they achieve. Our Objective and Key Results (OKRs) conversations are therefore pivotal in validating that we are performing. We communicate our OKRs in team meetings in management supervision and each quarterly appraisal is centred around individual OKRs.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong>	Our response to any individual performance management concerns will always be to attempt to support the individual to address the issue, rather than seeking to blame or punish staff. We will seek to provide additional coaching, support and feedback to help staff to achieve their goals.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	If there are ongoing concerns that are not being addressed by the staff member despite support to do so, it may become necessary to refer the issue to the disciplinary procedure (see section 8).</p> <p><strong>6.4</strong>	Performance at the individual level is measured and promoted through the OKRs. Tideway Care also monitors its own performance as an employer through various metrics reported to the SMT.</p> <h2 id="_7-sickness-absence-and-presenteeism"><a href="#_7-sickness-absence-and-presenteeism" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7. Sickness, Absence and Presenteeism</h2> <p><strong>7.1</strong>	The health and wellbeing of staff is important to us and we understand how physically and emotionally demanding supporting other people can be. We therefore want to avoid high levels of sickness and absence which would indicate to us that we are not supporting our staff well enough. This means that we will invest in the wellbeing and retention of staff, treating our staff how we would want to be treated as employees.</p> <p><strong>7.2</strong>	Presenteeism is actively discouraged; we do not want our staff to come into work if they are unwell or work over their contracted hours because they are worried about their job. This is not a culture we encourage. We do encourage people to go the extra mile but not at the risk of their health and wellbeing. There is clear evidence that presenteeism correlates with a reduction in productivity and longer-term sickness.</p> <p><strong>7.3</strong> <strong>Annual Leave</strong></p> <ul><li><p>Annual leave is determined in staff contracts and details of minimum statutory annual leave entitlements can be found in the staff handbook</p></li> <li><p>To request annual leave; the more notice you can give the better so that it can be factored in with staff rotas and cover can be planned and arranged. Staff are required to have annual leave signed off by the Team Leader / Manager who will keep the staff annual leave taken records</p></li> <li><p>You shouldn’t book holiday hotels and travel arrangements before discussing dates with your manager. It is important for the team to be able to work together to cover shifts and avoid the need for agency staff to be used</p></li> <li><p>Bank holidays are included in your annual leave allowance and treated in the same way</p></li> <li><p>Periods of high annual leave requirements include school holidays and particularly summer and Christmas holidays. We will do our best to accommodate requests but ask that you work with your team to cover the shifts fairly and equitably. The Team Manager /Leader will have ultimate overview of leave and authority to refuse requests if necessary but wish to avoid this if the team can make it work for the people we support</p></li> <li><p>Annual leave allowances run from January to December and will re-set in January. We encourage all employees to use their leave allowance within the year, in exceptional circumstances we may arrange for an amount of leave to be carried forwards to the following year, but this is generally discouraged</p></li> <li><p>Staff may also want to take unpaid leave or a sabbatical. This can be arranged with your line manager who is the person who can authorise this</p></li></ul> <p><strong>7.4</strong> <strong>Sickness Leave</strong></p> <ul><li><p>Staff are asked to report to their immediate line manager or nominated deputy as soon as it is clear they are not able to attend work</p></li> <li><p>Managers must log this absence and organise for shift/s to be covered</p></li> <li><p>Staff members can self-certificate for up to 7 days</p></li> <li><p>Staff members are required to send their line manager a completed doctors’ sick certificate if the period of sickness is going to last more than 7 days</p></li> <li><p>Staff members are required to notify their line manager as soon as they are aware they can return to work. They need to be able to discuss whether they need a phased return after a long period of sick leave</p></li> <li><p>The manager will facilitate a return to work interview and complete the return to work form</p></li> <li><p>If a phased return is required, the manager will review this within an agreed time frame with the staff member</p></li> <li><p>Periods of frequent short-term leave will signal a review with the staff member to ascertain whether they are receiving adequate support at work, require a significantly longer period of sick leave to fully recover or there are other factors at play</p></li> <li><p>The line manager will work with the staff member to resolve the issues and keep a record in their HR File</p></li> <li><p>Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)</p></li> <li><p>If you are too ill to work you are entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks paid by Tideway Care</p></li> <li><p>To qualify for SSP and have been off work sick for 4 or more days in a row (including non-working days)</p></li></ul> <p><strong>7.5</strong> <strong>Study Days</strong>: Tideway Care believe that education and learning are important and will support study days for agreed training and development events. We would like our staff to always consider the following:</p> <ul><li>If committed to attend they must attend; so that the space is not wasted</li> <li>To organise their own travel requirements if needed and within our <a href="/Policies/HR03.html">Expenses Policy</a></li> <li>To feedback learning to their team and beyond, if helpful</li> <li>To ensure the training is linked to their appraisal and OKRs</li></ul> <p><strong>7.6</strong> <strong>Maternity and Paternity Leave</strong>: Employees (including a de facto or same sex partner, or single person) who are expecting a child or adopting a child are eligible for 52 weeks of unpaid parental leave if they are:</p> <ul><li><p>permanent full-time or part-time with at least 12 months service prior to the expected date of birth or adoption placement</p></li> <li><p>After birth or adoption, the parent with responsibility for the care of the child is entitled to unpaid parental leave.

Disciplinary Procedure</h2> <p><strong>8.1</strong>	As your employer, we can start formal disciplinary action against you if we have concerns about your work, conduct or absence. Before taking formal disciplinary action or dismissing you, we will raise the issues with you through management supervision in the first instance to see how we can avoid disciplinary action. However, we can go straight to formal disciplinary or dismissal procedures if there is evidence you have behaved in an illegal [or malicious] manner or put the safety of others at risk.</p> <p><strong>8.2</strong>	If a manager is required to take disciplinary action they must follow these steps:</p> <ul><li><p>Line Manager to write a letter to the staff member to highlight the concerns, reason for action and invite them to a meeting to discuss the matter</p></li> <li><p>The staff member may bring a person to support them for the meeting</p></li> <li><p>At the meeting the line manager will explain the concerns, go through the evidence and give the person a chance to give their views on what is being discussed</p></li> <li><p>If the staff member raises a significant new fact or issue at the meeting your employer might stop it and look into the issue.
