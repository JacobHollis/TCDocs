This is to focus on staff interactions with the people we support and their families to explore ways in working with them to improve outcomes. It is undertaken with a PBS Practitioner and will occur weekly.</li> <li><strong>Reflective practice:</strong>
Reflective practice is about taking time either individually or in a group to think and review what has occurred and consider whether things could have been different if the staff interactions or the environment had been different. This is useful after an incident or a complaint has bene made or to work through a scenario that has not gone well or one that has gone very well to clarify lessons learnt.</li> <li><strong>Informal supervision:</strong>
This is when staff seek some advice or want to check something out with a peer or line manager. It is not documented or recorded in anyway but provides you with support.
