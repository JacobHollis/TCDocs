Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care support people to take control of their money and manage it independently as far as is possible; however, we recognise that the people we support may require assistance with their money. This may include help when shopping, budgeting, paying bills, etc. and may mean that staff are asked to handle their money for them. Our staff must be clear around their roles and responsibilities in relation to money management.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	This policy supports a reasonable balance between the rights of the people we support for choice and confidentiality, and those of staff for safety and security.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	It is also important for our staff to understand the legalities of supporting people with their money and circumstances where other people oversee another person’s money. This will help highlight where an abuse of this role may be taking place and ensure it is reported through the safeguarding policy and procedures.</p> <h2 id="_2-principles"><a href="#_2-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.	Principles</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	The people we support have the right to spend their own money how they wish to and to keep their affairs private.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	When a person states they want a relative to look after their money the following applies:</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	Some people we support will lack capacity to manage their money and the Mental Capacity Act Policy must be followed in these instances.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	When a person asks staff to keep their money safe for them for a period of time the following applies: Written records of any money matters must be recorded in the care notes and a separate log book is held in a safe in an accommodation-based service in a staff office. We discourage the practice of centrally held money belonging to the people we support and will explore alternative options in the first instance.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	Should there be a need for a centrally held safe the Registered Manager will be responsible for ensuring no money is pooled and records of individual balances and transactions are kept up to date and checked on a weekly basis.</p> <h2 id="_3-money-management-support"><a href="#_3-money-management-support" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3.	Money management support</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	All the people we support will have clear assessments of their money management needs and identification of their preferences regarding their money. For those assessed as lacking capacity or who have requested support in managing their money; this will be clearly documented and a support plan in place to ensure this situation is reviewed frequently.</p> <p>Part of the assessment will be identifying areas for which the person requires support:</p> <ul><li>Who has control?</li> <li>Is capacity an issue?</li> <li>Do they know how to keep their money safe?</li> <li>Do they need support with:
<ul><li>Budgeting</li> <li>Banking</li> <li>Shopping</li> <li>Paying bills</li> <li>Benefits</li> <li>Saving for days out / holidays/ etc</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	Support Plans in relation to any money management issues should be reviewed with the person you support at least monthly or sooner if there is a highlighted risk.</p> <h2 id="_4-dos-and-don’ts"><a href="#_4-dos-and-don’ts" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.	Dos and Don’ts</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong> <strong>Do</strong></p> <ul><li>Encourage the people we support to arrange for all their bills to be paid direct from their bank account by standing order or direct debit. Where this is not possible, and a member of staff is involved in the payment, they should be paid as close to the person’s home as possible; e.g. local post office or bank</li> <li>Check that any support with financial transactions is only to be undertaken following agreement by the team and detailed on the person we support’s care and support plan</li> <li>Record all transactions you are involved in on the care notes system as close to the intervention as is possible</li> <li>Review the person’s ability to manage their money and look for signs of deterioration of ability or an increase in understanding and ability and discuss with the team</li> <li>Always secure monies before leaving the post office or the person we support’s home, and do not handle outside. It is also preferable for collection of large amounts to be undertaken by car rather than on foot</li> <li>Ensure that the person we support’s money is used to pay for purchases or bills on the same day that it is given to the member of staff; it must not be carried around by the member of staff for payment at a later date</li> <li>Only perform duties for one person at a time</li> <li>Ensure the person gives sufficient money to the member of staff, in advance of the purchase being made or the bill being paid</li> <li>When handing change to a person we support, the amount should always be agreed by both parties as correct with the receipt</li></ul> <p><strong>4.2</strong> <strong>Don’t</strong></p> <ul><li>Withdraw money from Post Offices or banks using a person we support’s debit/ credit card or PIN system (pensions)</li> <li>Undertake shopping for a person we support using a debit or credit card</li> <li>Take a person’s money to your own home or leave it unattended</li> <li>Use your own money to make purchases or to pay bills for a person we support with the expectation of being reimbursed by them</li> <li>Use a person we support’s money for any purpose other than for which they gave it to you</li> <li>Purchase your own shopping or pay your own personal bills whilst you are working even if you are supporting someone else to do the same</li> <li>Use your own personal shopping “loyalty” or membership cards whilst buying anything on behalf of a person we support</li> <li>Staff must not retain any money belonging to a person we support on their behalf; even at their request. If a person needs help with managing their finances, the Team Manager or Intermediate Tier Co-ordinator must be informed and recorded on the care and support plan</li> <li>Give advice about banking or any other aspects of financial management unless it is agreed by the team as required and recorded in support plans</li> <li>Accept money as a gift from a person we support or allow them to purchase something on our behalf</li></ul> <h2 id="_5-keeping-money-safe"><a href="#_5-keeping-money-safe" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5.	Keeping money safe</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	Part of supporting people with their money will be checking that they know how to keep their money safe in their homes and when they are out in the community.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	If you are asked to keep money safe on behalf of a person you support, please discuss with your line manager as we discourage this but can look at the options in order to agree with them how best to support their needs.</p> <h2 id="_6-when-other-people-are-responsible-for-a-person’s-money"><a href="#_6-when-other-people-are-responsible-for-a-person’s-money" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6.	When other people are responsible for a person’s money</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	Following a Mental Capacity assessment and Best Interest Decision a person may be deemed unsafe to look after their own money. In these circumstances there are a number of options for someone else to look after their money for them. This is likely to fall to a close relative or the local authority.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong> <strong>Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) Appointee:</strong> The appointee is responsible for claiming benefits and notifying any change in circumstances to the Department for Work and Pensions.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	The appointee cannot deal with any income derived from sources other than statutory benefits. The appointee can be a family member or friend. The Department for Work and Pensions may require medical evidence that the claimant is unable to act.</p> <p><strong>6.4</strong>	The Council will apply to the Department for Work and Pensions to be made an appointee for the person where:</p> <ul><li>A person is in receipt of statutory benefits and lacks capacity to fully manage those benefits</li> <li>There is no one suitable to assist the person to do so, or to act as appointee</li> <li>There have been documented safeguarding concerns regarding how the person’s finances are currently being managed</li> <li>It is otherwise appropriate to do so</li></ul> <p><strong>6.5</strong>	Responsibilities of an appointee include:</p> <ul><li>Establishing what benefits or allowances the person is entitled to</li> <li>Completing any necessary claim forms on their behalf</li> <li>Ensuring payments are applied for the benefit of the person</li> <li>Informing the Department for Work and Pensions immediately of any change in the person's circumstances and dealing with any resulting queries or correspondence</li> <li>Carrying out instructions received about benefits</li> <li>If the benefit is paid into a bank, building society or Post Office card account, informing the relevant office of any changes to the account details</li> <li>Repaying overpayments of benefits when legally required to do so</li></ul> <p><strong>6.6</strong>	The Department for Work and Pensions or the Council may terminate the appointeeship at any time. The person may end the arrangement if they regain capacity to manage the benefits payments themselves. An instruction must be submitted in writing to the relevant benefit office. Where a relative wishes to take over the appointeeship from the Council and the person lacks capacity to make this decision, a Best Interests decision must be made.</p> <p><strong>6.7</strong> <strong>Deputyship:</strong> Where the financial affairs of a person are complex, or there are substantial assets, it may be necessary for a Deputy to be appointed by the Court of Protection.</p> <p><strong>6.8</strong>	A Deputy has the power to make financial decisions on behalf of the person lacking capacity to do so. The powers of a Deputy are subject to restrictions imposed by legislation and to any restrictions imposed by the Court.</p> <p><strong>6.9</strong>	The Council will normally request that the Court of Protection appoints a panel deputy. The Council will only agree to be appointed as a Deputy for a person in exceptional circumstances. Where the Council is appointed as a Deputy, the named deputy will be the Director of Adult &amp; Community Services, who will represent the person at any Court of Protection hearings.</p> <p><strong>6.10</strong> <strong>Money Management Account:</strong> Where the Council is acting as appointee, or under a Court Order, or as a Deputy, in relation to the financial affairs of a person, it will open a money management account for the person.</p> <p><strong>6.11</strong>	The person's income and, where appropriate, savings will be maintained in the account. Other forms of investment Large balances (over £25k) will be brought to the attention of the Adult Social Care Department and Treasury Management so that the suitability of maintaining the current bank account can be compared with other suitable alternatives.</p> <p><strong>6.12</strong>	Enduring and Lasting Powers of Attorney
If a person has made a valid Enduring or Lasting Power of Attorney for property and financial affairs, at a time when they had capacity to do so, the Council would usually expect the attorney to manage the person’s finances. However, if the Council believes that the attorney is not acting in the best interests of the person, it may make representations to the Office of the Public Guardian or apply to the Court of Protection for the power to be revoked. Before doing so, there should normally be a Safeguarding meeting and legal advice should be taken.</p> <h2 id="_7-0reporting"><a href="#_7-0reporting" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7.0	Reporting</h2> <p><strong>7.1</strong>	Staff must always report to their line manager in any situation in which they feel vulnerable when dealing with the people we support’s money. This is particularly important if the person lacks capacity to make decisions for themselves or is likely to be subject of financial abuse.</p> <p><strong>7.2</strong>	Any suspected thefts must be reported to your line manager as soon as possible and any incidents of staff being accused by the people we support, and/or their representatives of negligence must be reported to your line manager and the Team Manager as soon as possible. The team manager will notify the police as appropriate if a crime is suspected after initial investigation. A safeguarding report will also be made.</p> <p><strong>7.3</strong>	All reports of actual or suspected financial abuse must be logged on the incident system and any lessons learnt shared following any investigations</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/7/2018, 10:57:29 AM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
