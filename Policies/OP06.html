PBS may be understood as a framework that gives equal emphasis to creating ‘capable environments’ for people as it does individualised interventions for complex and challenging behaviour.</p> <p>The four composites of PBS as defined by Macdonald 2017 give us much more context around the approach as a framework not just an intervention: See <a href="/Policies/OP06Appendix01.html">Appendix 1</a>.</p> <ul><li>Use of behavioural technology</li> <li>Based on specific values</li> <li>Focus on quality of life</li> <li>Commitment to systems change</li></ul> <p>Our approach attempts to enshrine these composites into our organisational culture, values and infrastructure through a harmonious alignment of all systems and policies.
We provide details on the PBS model in <a href="/Policies/OP06.html#_5-restrictive-practice-reduction-planning">section 5 of this policy</a>.</p> <h3 id="policy-outcome"><a href="#policy-outcome" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Policy Outcome</h3> <p>After reading this policy you will be able to:</p> <ul><li>Understand Tideway Care’s approach to managing behaviours that challenge</li> <li>Support the values and principles behind PBS</li> <li>Work to support a reduction in the use of restrictive practices and only use physical interventions as a last resort</li> <li>Understand what the important components are for facilitating the implementation of a PBS Plan.</li></ul> <h2 id="_1-introduction"><a href="#_1-introduction" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1. Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) is Tideway Care’s chosen intervention for the assessment, intervention and monitoring of challenging behaviour. The approach has been well researched and it stands solidly at the centre of educational and learning disability / autism services as the preferred approach for managing behaviours that challenge services. For the purpose of this policy we will refer to ‘challenging behaviours’ as the commonly used label; but our goal is for people to see these as behaviours that challenge us as support providers in thinking about how we can better provide the environment and service approach to reduce the need for them.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	PBS has to be embedded in the culture and leadership of our services to ensure we are able to deliver positive outcomes for the people we support.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	Tideway Care firmly believe our vision and values are in line with the PBS concepts:</p> <ul><li>Always treating people how we would want to be treated ourselves</li> <li>Striving passionately to be the best and not afraid to challenge the norm</li> <li>Focussing on the positive, finding silver linings and never giving up</li></ul> <h2 id="_2-regulatory-and-policy-position"><a href="#_2-regulatory-and-policy-position" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Regulatory and policy position</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has the power to take action against providers who use control or restraint that is not provided in accordance with guidance and standards issued by appropriate professional and expert bodies, is unlawful, or is not necessary to prevent, or proportional to the risk posed were restraint not used.  Where the Positive and Proactive guidance is not used by organisations, the CQC will consider using its regulatory powers to facilitate change and improvement in local services.  This will incorporate:</p> <ul><li>Renewed focus on restraint</li> <li>Review of site progress against the reducing restrictive practices principles</li> <li>Scrutiny of the quality of Behavioural Support Plans (Programme).</li></ul> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	This policy should also be considered in relation to the Tideway Care safeguarding policies and procedures to ensure that the safety and wellbeing of the people we support is unequivocal. The following policy and guidance have been used to develop this document:</p> <ul><li>Positive and Proactive Care: reducing the need for restrictive interventions (2014)</li> <li>A Positive and Proactive Workforce (2014)</li> <li>NICE Guidance – Challenging behaviour and learning disabilities: prevention and interventions for people with learning disabilities whose behaviour challenges</li> <li>Positive Behavioural Support (PBS) Coalition UK.

BILD (2018)</li></ul> <h2 id="_3-positive-behaviour-support"><a href="#_3-positive-behaviour-support" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Positive Behaviour Support</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	All staff will be expected to create and support capable environments that improve wellbeing and quality of life for the people we support, whilst reducing challenging behaviour and the use of restrictive interventions. See <a href="/Policies/OP06Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 Positive Behaviour Support Approach Guidance</a>.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	Working with the ethos and framework for reducing challenging behaviour and the use of restrictive practices aims to increase the people we support’s quality of life and ability to gain more independence through acquiring new skills and abilities.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	Our programme development approach is detailed in, <a href="/Policies/OP05.html">OP05 Programme Development</a>. The policy describes the way in which we co-produce the programme with the people we support and use a range of frameworks to assist in identifying goals and desired outcomes; these include Functional Behaviour and Risk Assessments, Person Centred Planning tools and PERMA which promotes psychological wellbeing.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">The 5 domains to the PERMA model are:</p> <ol><li><strong>P</strong>ositive Emotion</li> <li><strong>E</strong>ngagement</li> <li><strong>R</strong>elationships</li> <li><strong>M</strong>eaning</li> <li><strong>A</strong>ccomplishment</li></ol></div> <p><strong>3.4</strong>	The programme develops goals under four categories, Keeping Safe, Keeping Healthy, Keeping Well and Keeping Connected. The reduction of challenging behaviours through PBS can cross into all of these areas, although may be concentrated in the Keeping Safe category.</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong> <strong>PBS Training</strong>: All staff will be expected to participate in and be coached in PBS values and approaches.</p> <ul><li>The curriculum for workforce development is based upon the Positive Behavioural Support (PBS): A Competence Framework 2015.</li> <li>As outlined in the PBS competence framework differentiated training will be targeted at the following levels:
<ul><li>Foundation (Direct support)</li> <li>Intermediate (Behaviour Specialist/Supervisory/Managerial)</li> <li>Advanced (Higher Level Behaviour Specialist/Organisational/Consultant)</li></ul></li></ul> <p><strong>3.6</strong>	Training will be structured to focus on:</p> <ul><li>Knowledge acquisition</li> <li>Practice based training</li> <li>Developing skills (competencies)</li> <li>Cultivating a healthy culture</li></ul> <h2 id="_4-risk-assessment-and-management"><a href="#_4-risk-assessment-and-management" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Risk Assessment and Management</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	The Care Act requires providers to ensure we risk asses for potential harm and put in place plans to eliminate or reduce the risk and manage the event of a near miss or actual harm occurring.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	The risks we may assess for the people we support will be related to their challenging behaviours or unpredictability as a consequence of their mental health symptoms.  In the PBS model we will include the process of assessing and managing risk and embed this in the programmes.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	Risk associated with people with a Learning Disability and or Autism tend to fall in to the following categories:</p> <ul><li>Neglect</li> <li>Self Harm</li> <li>Aggression</li> <li>Violence</li> <li>Exploitation</li> <li>Self Injury</li> <li>Physical health issues - PICA (eating or mouthing non-edible items) and higher proportion of physical health LTCs</li> <li>Physical challenging behaviour such as biting, spitting, hitting and hair pulling</li> <li>Infection – Smearing</li></ul> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	Many people with a learning disability and or autism may also have mental health needs that can lead to behaviours that challenge. Please refer to <a href="/Policies/OP06Appendix03.html">Appendix 3 Risk Assessment and Management Guidance</a>.</p> <h2 id="_5-restrictive-practice-reduction-planning"><a href="#_5-restrictive-practice-reduction-planning" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Restrictive Practice Reduction Planning</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	Restrictive interventions are often a major contribution to delaying recovery, and have been linked with causing serious trauma, both physical and psychological, to people who use services and staff. “These interventions have been used too much, for too long and we must change this”. (Norman Lamb; DH April 2014)</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	The publication Positive and Proactive Care: Reducing the Need for Restrictive Interventions (April 2014) provides a framework and guidance on the delivery of recovery based care which will result in the reduction for the need for restrictive interventions.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong>	This includes the following areas that Health and Social Care services must adopt:</p> <ul><li>Restrictive intervention reduction programmes</li> <li>Individualised recovery-based approaches</li> <li>The use of Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) plans, where appropriate</li> <li>Whole service approaches such as reducing blanket restrictions</li> <li>Reducing and managing conflict through practical approaches, such as those used in the Safewards model (Bowers, L. (2014) Safewards: a new model of conflict and containment on psychiatric wards London: Institute of Psychiatry)</li> <li>Post-incident reviews which take into account the physical and emotional impact on individuals; help people who use services and staff to identify what led to the incident and what could have been done differently and where appropriate recommend changes to the service’s philosophy, policies, treatment approaches, staff education and training.</li></ul> <p><strong>5.4</strong>	Individual Level Strategies:</p> <ul><li>Individualised needs assessment (including functional behaviour assessment)</li> <li>PBS programme that clearly focus on promotion of wellbeing and the prevention of incidents</li> <li>PBS programmes that are based on a functional understanding of behaviour</li> <li>Targeted behavioural interventions aimed at reducing the need for challenging behaviour through constructive approaches (such as skills building)</li></ul> <p><strong>5.5</strong>	System Wide Strategies:</p> <ul><li>A clear and explicit values base and a focus on cultivating a healthy culture</li> <li>A competency based workforce development curriculum</li> <li>A focus on practice leadership training and support for staff in supervisory roles</li> <li>Strategic implementation of data based system to recognise successes and to identify opportunities for improvement</li> <li>Openness and transparency with families and other key stakeholders</li> <li>Development of a delivery strategy that will be regularly reviewed by the SMT</li></ul> <p><strong>5.6</strong>	Service commissioners:</p> <ul><li>will not place people in services which use restrictive interventions unless these services have robust, regularly reviewed organisational restrictive intervention reduction programmes.</li> <li>must be informed about restrictive interventions used for those for whom they have responsibility.</li> <li>will assure themselves that commissioned services have mechanisms in place to ensure that physical interventions are delivered in as safe a manner as possible.</li> <li>will take concerted and timely action as part of contract compliance where this is not the case.</li></ul> <h2 id="_6-restrictive-interventions"><a href="#_6-restrictive-interventions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Restrictive Interventions</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	Restrictive Interventions sometimes used in hospitals and other settings are defined by the department of health (2014) as follows:</p> <ul><li><p><strong>Physical restraint</strong> - ‘Any direct physical contact where the intervener’s intention is to prevent, restrict, or subdue movement of the body, or part of the body of another person’.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mechanical restraint</strong> - ‘The use of a device to prevent, restrict or subdue movement of a person’s body, or part of the body, for the primary purpose of behavioural control’</p></li> <li><p><strong>Chemical restraint</strong> - ‘The use of medication which is prescribed, and administered for the purpose of controlling or subduing disturbed/violent behaviour, where it is not prescribed for the treatment of a formally identified physical or mental illness’</p></li> <li><p><strong>Seclusion</strong> - ‘The supervised confinement and isolation of a person, away from other users of services, in an area from which the person is prevented from leaving.’

people without their consent and as part of a PBS plan. In relation to capacity and best interest
decisions there are circumstances where restrictions can be put in place for the safety and wellbeing

Physical Interventions</h2> <p><strong>7.1</strong>	Physical intervention is the last resort in any situation; we will invest in training, coaching and supervising our staff to minimise the potential for physical intervention.</p> <p><strong>7.2</strong>	In the 2014 the Department of Health guidance framework Positive and Proactive Care: reducing the need for restrictive interventions restraint is defined in the following way: ‘deliberate acts on the part of other person(s) that restrict an individual’s movement, liberty and/or freedom to act independently in order to:</p> <ul><li>Take immediate control of a dangerous situation where there is a real possibility of harm to the person or others if no action is undertaken; and</li> <li>End or reduce significantly the danger to the person or others; and</li> <li>Contain or limit the person’s freedom for no longer than is necessary’. (Sect 17)</li></ul> <p><strong>7.3</strong>	DoH; Positive and Proactive Care: reducing the need for restrictive interventions (May 2014). There may be times when due to the complexity and severity of behaviour of the people we support, the use of restrictive interventions may be required. Restrictive interventions must only be used proportionately, as a last resort and in circumstances it is clear that there is no alternative.</p> <p><strong>7.4</strong>	The scale and nature of any physical intervention must be proportionate to both the behaviour of the individual, and the nature of the harm they might cause. These judgements have to be made at the time, taking due account of all the circumstances, including any known history of other events involving the individual. The minimum necessary force should be used, and the techniques deployed should be those with which the staff involved are trained in and able to use safely and are described in the individuals programme.</p> <p><strong>7.5</strong>	All staff will be expected to be trained and mentored in physical interventions as a last resort by qualified PROACT-SCIPr-UK® Trainers. Annual updates and revision of use via incident review processes will be monitored by the Governance, Quality and Performance Committee.</p> <p><strong>7.6</strong>	PROACT-SCIPr-UK® training is our current preferred approach to physical intervention training although this may change if another alternative approach is deemed to achieve better outcomes.</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <p><a href="/Policies/OP06Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - The Four composites of PBS – MacDonald, 2017</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP06Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Positive Behaviour Support Approach Guidance</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/OP06Appendix03.html">Appendix 2 - Risk Assessment and Management Guidance</a></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/8/2018, 3:38:46 PM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
