This policy applies to;</p> <ul><li>Our servers, personal computers, communication devices and any instances where personal devices are used to access company data or systems (‘Bring Your Own Device’ or ‘BYOD’)</li> <li>All software used on Tideway Care Systems, servers or cloud hosted arrangements, whether bespoke or third party provided</li> <li>All Tideway Care data and reports or other works derived from that data</li></ul> <h3 id="legal-regulatory-context"><a href="#legal-regulatory-context" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Legal &amp; Regulatory Context</h3> <p>This policy has been produced with reference to the following legislation, guidance and directives;</p> <ul><li>General Data Protection Regulations (2018)</li> <li>Computer Misuse Act (1990)</li></ul> <h3 id="equality-statement"><a href="#equality-statement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Equality Statement</h3> <p>In the implementation of this policy, Tideway Care will not discriminate against any colleague or customer on grounds of his/her race, ethnic origin, gender, sexuality, marital status, disability, age, religion or class.</p> <h3 id="policy-statement"><a href="#policy-statement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Policy Statement</h3> <p>Tideway Care is responsible for ensuring there are adequate arrangements in place to protect its data, systems, information processing capabilities and communication infrastructure from unauthorised access, use or distribution.</p> <p>The arrangements set out in this document provide guidance on the responsibilities that all staff must adhere to. Compliance with the rules set out in this policy is part of your contract of employment and failure to comply can result in disciplinary action. You should therefore take the time to read and understand this policy in full.</p> <h3 id="policy-outcome"><a href="#policy-outcome" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Policy Outcome</h3> <p>After reading this policy you will be able to:</p> <ul><li>Understand the arrangements in place to protect company data and systems</li> <li>Know what the rules are about how you should use Tideway Care devices and software</li> <li>Know where to go for help or more information if you are in any doubt</li></ul> <h2 id="_1-responsibilities"><a href="#_1-responsibilities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1. Responsibilities</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	All staff are responsible for understanding the measures set out in this policy and following the rules and guidelines provided. IT Security can be complex and confusing, and these rules exist to provide you with the tools to prevent any breaches.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	The IT Governance Lead is responsible for reviewing the organisational arrangements against best practice and ensuring that company data and systems are protected from unauthorised access or use. The IT Governance Lead will monitor systems through regular audit and report to the Quality &amp; Governance committee any breaches, incidents or suspicious activity along with details of any actions to be taken to improve IT security.</p> <h2 id="_2-your-user-accounts-and-passwords"><a href="#_2-your-user-accounts-and-passwords" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2 Your User Accounts and Passwords</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	All Tideway Care staff are provided with a user account that grants access to the information and systems you will need to do your job. You are responsible for any activity that occurs on any system that is accessed by your user account. You should not share your account with anyone, including other members of staff.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	Passwords: Your user account is protected by a password that you select, research suggests that the most effective protection against external breaches is to observe the following rules when selecting and maintaining passwords;</p> <ul><li>Choose a new password that you do not use anywhere else – Repeating the same password that you use on any other systems exposes your account to unnecessary risk</li> <li>Choose a strong password, try to use a mixture of upper and lower-case characters and include numbers and special characters</li> <li>Try to avoid choosing a password that anyone would be able to guess, don’t use passwords based on any information about you (names of family, pets etc). Some of the best passwords are a combination of a few randomly chosen words and numbers</li> <li>Never share your password with anyone or write them down, if anyone asks you for your password or you discover another user’s password this should be considered a security incident and reported immediately</li></ul> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	Multi-Factor Authentication: Additionally, where possible, user accounts should be protected by some form of multi-factor authentication (MFA). In Tideway Care implementations this means when the user successfully logs in using a username and password they are also prompted to verify themselves with the use of a device. All users should be enrolled in the Tideway Care MFA programme which is managed through Azure Active Directory. MFA can be achieved via phone call, text message or the Microsoft Authenticator App. Users are able to select their MFA method and adjust their own settings by accessing their user profile on the Office 365 portal. If you lose the device you rely on for MFA verification this should be reported as a security incident immediately.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	When developing or purchasing applications for use in Tideway Care the following are considered minimum standards for passwords and user accounts;</p> <ul><li>Systems must support authentication of individual users, not groups</li> <li>Passwords must not be stored or transmitted in clear text or in any easily reversible or cracked form</li> <li>User accounts should include some form of role management such that one user can take over the functions of another when necessary without needing to know the other user’s password</li> <li>Passwords should be able to be re-set without the need for users to share their password with an administrator</li></ul> <h2 id="_3-use-of-email"><a href="#_3-use-of-email" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Use of Email</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	Your Tideway Care Username is linked to your Tideway Care Email account and provides you with access to a company mailbox as well as any shared mailboxes, calendars or other resources that are assigned to you by the administrators.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	Company email should only be accessed via a company supplied device using the recommended and pre-installed email client unless you have been specifically authorised to access email via any other method. This means you should NOT attempt to login to company emails using any device not supplied and managed by Tideway Care without prior authorisation.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	When using company email it is important to be aware that you are acting as a representative of Tideway Care and anything you say can reflect on the entire organisation. You should NOT use company email to conduct any correspondence that;</p> <ul><li>Is or could be libellous, harassing or offensive</li> <li>Is unsolicited or does not have a legal and fair basis (see Data Protection Policy)</li> <li>Forged or intended to appear as if sent from another person</li> <li>Breaches any copyright or licencing laws, or infringes on another’s intellectual property</li> <li>Includes chain letters, joke emails or other communication not specifically for the purposes of Tideway Care business</li></ul> <p><strong>3.4</strong>	Personal or sensitive Information in Emails: Email is inherently not a secure means of transmission and email should never be used to distribute sensitive personal information or anything commercially sensitive. If you need to send something which could be considered sensitive (including any details about a person we support) you must find alternative secure methods of transmission.</p> <p>The means by which you can share sensitive information will often depend on who you are sending it to, if in doubt please contact your line manager or IT support to discuss your individual requirements before sending anything.</p> <h2 id="_4-devices"><a href="#_4-devices" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Devices</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	Company Owned Devices: Tideway Care provides the following types of device to individual users depending on the needs of their job roles;</p> <ul><li>Company Managed Mobile Phones: These will be supplied to users already enrolled in the company mobile device management (MDM) scheme. The device will be tied to the user’s account and should not be used by other members of staff. The device will have an associated call, text and data plan to enable the user to access company resources and make phone calls as required.</li> <li>Company Managed User Laptops: These will also be supplied to users already enrolled in the MDM and should not be shared across users. Devices will be supplied with all necessary software pre-installed and configured.</li></ul> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	Company Managed Shared PCs: In addition to user devices listed above the company will make available shared PCs in office locations to allow users to access training materials etc. When using shared PCs it is still important to only use your own User Account and ensure you log out of the machine completely when you are finished using it.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	Use of Company Owned Devices: By using a Tideway Care device you agree to follow all of the guidance set out in this document. You are responsible for minimising the risk of viruses and malware by not installing any software unless specifically approved by Tideway Care. As a general rule if a piece of software was not installed when the device was supplied it has not yet been approved, please contact IT support if you need to request authorisation to use any software.</p> <p>You are also responsible for taking reasonable measures to ensure the physical safety of these devices, they should not be left unattended and you should make efforts to ensure they are used and transported safely (eg using cases, screen protectors etc). If a company device is lost or damaged please report this immediately to your line manager and/or IT support.</p> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	Bring Your Own Device (BYOD): In the vast majority of cases users should only access any company resources from a company managed and owned device that has been supplied to them specifically for those purposes. Tideway Care will endeavour to ensure the devices it supplies are able to meet all the needs of its users thus minimising the need for any BYOD activity. In certain circumstances where it is preferable for both the user and the business we may permit BYOD, users should seek specific authorisation from the IT Governance Lead and the Operations Director before attempting to access any company resource from a personally owned device.</p> <p>In instances where BYOD is specifically approved the user and their device should first be assessed to ensure allowing BYOD does not introduce any additional undue risk. As Tideway Care can impose more rigorous security restrictions on its own devices the company should generally attempt to provide a device that meets the user’s need as a first course of action.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong>	Minimum Standards for Device Security: All devices that access Tideway Care resources must meet the following minimum standards;</p> <ul><li>Devices must be protected by robust password, PIN or biometric access methods (eg fingerprint scanners)</li> <li>Devices must be encrypted</li> <li>Devices must not be ‘jail-broken’, ‘rooted’ or otherwise modified from manufacturer default configurations</li> <li>Devices must be compatible with Tideway Care’s MDM software, allowing remote-wipe of company data in cases where a device may be compromised</li></ul> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	Device Security Practices: All staff should note the following practices when using any device that has access to Tideway Care Data:-</p> <ul><li>Do not interfere with any system level settings that may compromise any of the above device security standards (eg. switching encryption off etc)</li> <li>Never leave a device unattended without locking the screen first – This includes situations where other members of staff are present; if you are walking away from the device – lock it first</li> <li>Always log out and switch off a device that is not in use</li> <li>Ensure devices are locked away securely when not in use</li> <li>Never install unauthorised software</li> <li>Do not click on suspicious links on the web or in emails</li> <li>Keep devices away from food and drink</li></ul> <h2 id="_5-software-information-storage"><a href="#_5-software-information-storage" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Software &amp; Information Storage</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	Your Tideway Care user account provides access to the company Sharepoint site which includes a document library that you may use to store necessary files and various resources such as policy documents, training files etc. You should not store any work-related files in locations other than the company SharePoint unless specifically directed to do so. Storing files on a device as opposed to in the company document library introduces risks as they may not be properly backed up or restorable. Storing files in any other external cloud-based solutions is strictly forbidden.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	Tideway Care utilises a variety of bespoke and third-party applications to perform business functions, you will be given access to the systems you require and will receive training on how to use them as part of your induction. All of the principles outlined in this document (for example selecting strong passwords that are not used elsewhere) still apply to all of these applications regardless of whether they are hosted by Tideway Care or not.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong>	Never insert or attach any form of removable media to a device with access to company data, this includes but is not limited to:</p> <ul><li>Memory cards</li> <li>USB drives/ Pen drives</li> <li>CDs, DVDs, Blu-Ray discs, floppy disks etc (Blank or otherwise)</li> <li>Network Attached Storage Devices (NAS)</li></ul> <p>If a situation arises where it would seem necessary to use any of the above and you cannot find an alternative method, please contact IT support for advice. Removable media is one of the most common ways that malware can spread and also presents significantly increased risks of data loss. Data stored in the company Sharepoint is securely access-controlled and backed-up, the company cannot guarantee the safety or security of data which is moved to media beyond our control.</p> <h2 id="_6-reporting-security-concerns"><a href="#_6-reporting-security-concerns" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Reporting Security Concerns</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	If you have any concerns about the security of Tideway Care information, systems and devices or about anything that could pose a risk to personal or sensitive data please do not hesitate to report your concerns to you line manager, a member of the SMT or to IT support.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong>	IT Support can be reached by emailing ITSupport@tidewaycare.com, further contact details are also supplied in the company portal app on all devices.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	If at any point it is identified that the security of any Tideway Care data has been actively compromised this should be treated as an incident and subjected to a full review. If incidents occur the IT Governance lead should make formal recommendations to the Quality and Governance Committee based on the learnings from any reviews of those incidents.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/7/2018, 10:57:29 AM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
