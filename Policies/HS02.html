Our training modules on infection control can be modified for the people we support to undertake.

Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care is committed to the prevention and management of infectious diseases and advocates for excellent hygiene in our services and the homes of the people we support.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	In the home care and supported living setting we must remember that we are entering peopleâs homes and respect any preferences around how they manage their home. It is not for us to impose standards of cleanliness and nor is it our place to dictate how they deal with issues such as food hygiene and use of protective clothing. However, we do have a duty of care to flag when things may lead to harm; i.e. an infection and to act swiftly to avoid it.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	We will always work with people to advocate for good hygiene practice and ensure we role model good practices in all that we do. This will include use of gloves for helping to clean up bodily fluids and washing hands appropriately. Equally we need to be aware of some people having difficulties with obsessive compulsive behaviours where there is excessive cleaning to their own detriment. We will support them to reduce this to a more appropriate level with their consent.</p> <h2 id="_2-standard-precautions"><a href="#_2-standard-precautions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Standard Precautions</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	Standard precautions are applied during working practices to protect the people we support, family, staff and visitors from infection. All blood and body fluids are capable of transmitting infection. Standard precautions are the basic minimum standard of hygiene to be applied throughout all contact with blood and body fluids from any source. It is the basis for controlling the spread of infection via blood and body fluids within clinical practice. Body fluids you are most likely to come into contact with include:</p> <ul><li>blood</li> <li>faeces</li> <li>urine</li> <li>vomit</li></ul> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	Standard precautions include:</p> <ul><li>Handwashing</li> <li>Personal Protective equipment (PPE)</li> <li>Sharps Management</li> <li>Spillage Management</li> <li>Handling and Storage of specimens</li> <li>Clinical Waste Management</li> <li>Food Management</li> <li>Laundry Management</li></ul> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	Where ever possible equipment used will be single-use, disposable equipment. All equipment that is not disposable is thoroughly cleaned after use with hot water and detergent.</p> <h2 id="_3-hand-washing"><a href="#_3-hand-washing" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Hand Washing</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	Hand washing is one of the single most important procedures in the control of infection. Good hand hygiene should be undertaken by staff, the people we support and visitors. Regular, effective hand washing and drying, when done correctly, is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong> <strong>Procedure</strong>: All staff should always observe high standards of hygiene to protect themselves and the people we support from the unnecessary spread of infection.  All staff must therefore ensure that their hands are thoroughly washed and dried between seeing each and every person where direct contact is involved, no matter how minor the contact, this can include;</p> <ul><li>after handling any body fluids or waste or soiled items</li> <li>after handling specimens</li> <li>after using the toilet</li> <li>before handling foodstuffs</li> <li>before and after any care activity</li></ul> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	Hands should be washed thoroughly according to the national guidelines (See <a href="/Policies/HS02Appendix01.html">Appendix 1</a> for Handwashing Poster). Liquid soaps and disposable paper towels should be used rather than bar soaps and fabric towels.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong>	All cuts or abrasions, particularly on the hands, should be covered with waterproof dressings at all times.</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong>	Ordinary soap is considered to be effective for routine use in removing dirt and reducing levels of transient micro-organisms on the skin to acceptably safe levels.</p> <p><strong>3.6</strong>	The use of antiseptic or antimicrobial preparations is recommended if the person is known to have an infectious disease or are colonised with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) and may be required to attend a hospital setting. Antiseptic hand washing solutions may also be used in situations where effective hand washing is not possible.</p> <p><strong>3.7</strong>	To be effective hands should be thoroughly washed before the use of an alcoholic rub and again after the procedure or personal contact has ended. Hands must be wet under warm running water, apply enough liquid soap to cover all hand surfaces and wash all areas of the hands thoroughly, rinse well and dry using disposable paper towels.</p> <p><strong>3.8</strong>	Liquid soap is preferable to bar soap as bar soap can harbour micro-organisms. In health and social care settings, liquid soap should be wall mounted with a single use cartridge or bottle. To prevent contamination of liquid soap, dispensers should not be refilled/topped up.</p> <p><strong>3.9</strong>	Alcohol Hand Rubs are of particular value where hand washing facilities are limited or not available. They should be applied to dry, visibly clean hands. These products are only effective if hands are physically clean. It is important to wash hands which are visibly contaminated prior to its application.</p> <p><strong>3.10</strong>	Alcohol hand rub should not be used when dealing with a person with Norovirus (viral gastroenteritis) or Clostridium difficile as it is not effective.</p> <p><strong>3.11</strong>	Therefore, hand washing with liquid soap and warm water is vital when dealing with any person known to have had diarrhoea within the last 48 hours. Visitors should be encouraged to use alcohol hand rub when entering and leaving all health and social care settings. This is not usual in peopleâs own homes unless there is an identified need.</p> <h2 id="_4-personal-protective-equipment-ppe"><a href="#_4-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Personal Protective equipment (PPE)</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong> <strong>Gloves</strong>:  If contact with blood and/or body fluids, non-intact skin or mucous membranes, is anticipated or the person has a known infection, disposable gloves should be worn that are appropriate for the task.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	Clinical gloves must be powder-free and can be latex, nitrile or vinyl material. Glove selection should be based on risk assessment of:</p> <ul><li>the nature of the task</li> <li>the risk of contamination</li> <li>barrier efficacy of gloves</li></ul> <p>Gloves must comply with British and EN Standards and be CE marked. See <a href="/Policies/HS02Appendix02.html">Appendix 2</a> for details about types of gloves.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	All used gloves should be disposed of as clinical waste in a health and social care establishment (see Waste Management Guidance for further information). Gloves must be discarded after each procedure/care activity. The re-use of gloves is not recommended for the following reasons:</p> <ul><li>glove integrity can be damaged if in contact with substances such as isopropanol, ethanol, oils and disinfectants</li> <li>many gloves will develop micro-punctures very quickly and will no longer perform their barrier function</li> <li>there is a risk of transmission of infection</li> <li>washing of gloved hands or using an alcohol hand rub on gloves is considered unsafe practice.</li></ul> <p><strong>4.4</strong> <strong>Please note</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Adequate and suitable personal protective equipment and clothing is provided.</li> <li>All staff performing personal care must use disposable aprons. Disposable gloves must be worn when coming into direct contact with bodily fluids</li> <li>Sterile gloves are provided for clinical procedures such as applying dressings. These should be disposed of safely after each session of care and not reused. On no account should staff attempt to wash and reuse the gloves.</li> <li>Non-sterile gloves are provided for washing dirty or used instruments, clearing up blood or bodily fluids and for handling disinfectants.</li> <li>The responsibility for ordering and ensuring that supplies of gloves and aprons are readily available and accessible lies with Team Manager.</li> <li>Tideway Care endeavours to use non-latex products, any member of staff who suspects that they or a resident might be suffering from an allergic reaction to the gloves provided should stop using them immediately and inform their line manager. They should then consult their GP.</li></ul> <p><strong>4.5</strong> <strong>Aprons</strong>: Disposable aprons are impermeable to bacteria and water and protect the areas of maximum potential contamination on the front of the body (See <a href="/Policies/HS02Appendix03.html">Appendix 3</a> for âwhich Apronâ). A disposable apron should be worn whenever body fluids or other source of contamination is likely to soil the front of your clothing, especially when:</p> <ul><li>undertaking an aseptic non-touch technique</li> <li>assisting bathing a person</li> <li>dealing with a person with continence needs</li> <li>assisting a person with the use of a commode</li> <li>emptying catheter drainage bags</li> <li>making beds</li> <li>decontaminating equipment</li></ul> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	A disposable apron should be removed and disposed of after each task. Ensure that you dispose of aprons immediately after completing each task and use a new apron before moving on to another task that is identified as a risk to avoid cross contamination. Hand hygiene should be performed after removing the apron.</p> <p><strong>4.7</strong> <strong>Facial protection</strong>: A surgical mask should be worn to protect staff when there is a risk of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions splashing on to the face. Surgical masks should:</p> <ul><li>cover both the nose and mouth and not be allowed to dangle around the neck after use</li> <li>not be touched once put on</li> <li>be changed when they become moist</li> <li>be worn once and discarded as infectious waste. Hand hygiene must be performed after disposal.</li></ul> <p><strong>4.8</strong>	To protect staff when there is a risk of airborne transmission of infection: a disposable respirator providing a high protection factor should be used for this purpose, i.e., FFP3 disposable respirator. The need for this is highly unlikely. Examples of appropriate use are during aerosol generating/cough inducing procedures on people with open pulmonary TB, Pandemic influenza or during close contact with a person who has MDRTB (form of tuberculosis). The fit of the respiratory masks is critically important, all employees should be fit tested and trained before using a respirator. Additionally, a seal check should be carried out each time a respirator is worn.</p> <p><strong>4.9</strong> <strong>Eye Protection</strong>: If there is a risk of splashing of blood and/or body fluids to the face, safety spectacles or a visor should be worn to protect the eyes. Normal prescription glasses do not provide adequate protection and additional protection is required when splashing is anticipated. Non-disposable eye protection should be decontaminated appropriately following each use.</p> <h2 id="_5-sharps-management"><a href="#_5-sharps-management" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Sharps Management</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	The Health and Safety (Sharp Instruments in Healthcare) Regulations 2013 and associated guidance from the HSE, mandates that the unnecessary use of medical sharps should be avoided wherever possible. Always check that this is the only route for the person to have their treatment; especially if they are anxious about the use of needles. Sharps are usually needles and ampoules used in the administration of injections. It is unlikely that Tideway Care staff will be involved in administration but may support someone who self-administers them or helps a health professional administer them.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	Procedure for The Disposal of Sharps (e.g. Used Needles and Ampoules)</p> <ul><li>Where sharps are used, âsafer sharpsâ are employed wherever possible, such as safer syringes, etc.</li> <li>Sharps â typically needles or blades â must be disposed of in proper, purpose-built sharps disposal containers complying with BS 7320</li> <li>Sharps are never disposed of in ordinary or clinical waste bags</li> <li>Staff should never re-sheath needles</li> <li>Sharps boxes should never be overfilled</li> <li>When full, sharps boxes should be sealed, marked as hazardous waste and clearly labelled with the providers details</li> <li>Staff should never attempt to force sharps waste into an overfilled box</li> <li>Used, filled boxes should be stored securely until collected for incineration according to individual arrangements</li></ul> <p><strong>5.3</strong>	People who have insulin dependent diabetes or have other conditions requiring frequent use of needles to administer mediation must have their own sharps disposal container and dispose of it as agreed by the pharmacist.</p> <p><strong>5.4</strong>	In the event of an injury with a used or potentially contaminated needle:</p> <ul><li>Person must wash the area immediately and encourage bleeding if the skin is broken</li> <li>Staff should report the injury to their line manager immediately and ensure that an incident form is filled in</li> <li>Person should make an urgent appointment to see a GP or, if none is available, Accident and Emergency</li> <li>Managers should record and investigate the incident and ensure that the person is offered appropriate âpost-exposure prophylaxisâ and counselling as required</li></ul> <h2 id="_6-spillage-management"><a href="#_6-spillage-management" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Spillage management</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong> <strong>Cleaning and Procedures for the Cleaning of Spillages</strong>: All staff have a responsibility to help keep any Tideway care accommodation-based service clean and tidy and to identify areas which fall below acceptable or safe standards. In peopleâs own homes we can only advise and guide them to safely clean spillages and maintain a hygienic environment unless the environment becomes hazardous.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong>	Staff must treat every spillage of body fluids or body waste as quickly as possible and as potentially infectious. They should wear protective gloves and aprons and use disposable wipes wherever possible. Eye protection should also be used if there is risk of splashing.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	Procedure for spillages of body fluids</p> <table><thead><tr><th>Action</th> <th>Rationale</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td>Put on disposable apron and gloves (wear facial protection if there is a risk of splashing to the face)</td> <td>To protect against contamination</td></tr> <tr><td>Cover the spill with disposable paper towels</td> <td>To soak up fluid and prevent spreading</td></tr> <tr><td>Air the room as much as possible- open doors and windows</td> <td>To remove any fumes/smells</td></tr> <tr><td>Use appropriate household cleaners to create a disinfectant solution</td> <td>For disinfection of the spillage</td></tr> <tr><td>Pour solution over paper towels over the spillage and leave for 5-10 mins</td> <td>To disinfect the spillage</td></tr> <tr><td>Soak up excess liquids and remove any solid materials using paper towels and dispose as offensive waste if no known or suspected infection.

The Handling and Storage of Specimens</h2> <p><strong>7.1</strong>	When dealing with specimens:</p> <ul><li>they should be collected only if ordered by a GP</li> <li>they should be treated with equally high levels of caution</li> <li>they should be labelled clearly and packed into self-sealing bags and stored according to instructions prior to being taken to the GP for collection by the local laboratory.</li> <li>Non-sterile gloves should be worn when handling the specimen containers and hands should be washed afterwards</li></ul> <p><strong>7.2</strong>	In most cases; the people we support will only require assistance with taking a sample of urine to the GP or practice nurse or they may need support attending a phlebotomy clinic for the collection of a blood sample.</p> <h2 id="_8-clinical-waste-management"><a href="#_8-clinical-waste-management" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 8. Clinical Waste Management</h2> <p><strong>8.1</strong>	Clinical waste is defined in the Controlled Waste Regulations 1992. It refers to any waste that consists wholly or partly of:</p> <ul><li>Human or animal tissue</li> <li>Blood or bodily fluids</li> <li>Excretions</li> <li>Drugs or other pharmaceutical products</li> <li>Swabs or dressings</li> <li>Syringes, needles or other sharp instruments which, unless rendered safe, may prove hazardous to any person encountering it</li></ul> <p><strong>8.2</strong>	Clinical waste also refers to any other waste arising from medical, nursing, dental, veterinary, pharmaceutical or similar practice, investigation, treatment, teaching or research.</p> <p><strong>8.3</strong>	Non-clinical waste is disposed of in normal black plastic bags. When no more than three-quarters full, yellow sacks are sealed and stored safely to await collection by an authorised collector. Yellow bags are used only in pedal-type bins in clinical areas.</p> <h2 id="_9-food-handling"><a href="#_9-food-handling" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 9. Food Handling</h2> <p><strong>9.1</strong>	All staff should adhere to the homeâs food hygiene policy and ensure that all food prepared for residents is prepared, cooked, stored and presented in line with the high standards required by the Food Safety Act 1990 and the Food Hygiene (England) Regulations 2005.</p> <p><strong>9.2</strong>	Any member of staff who becomes ill while handling food should report at once to his or her line manager or supervisor.</p> <p><strong>9.3</strong>	Any storage or handling of food in the home raises a potential risk of food poisoning so the highest standards of hygiene must be observed by all staff at all times.</p> <p><strong>9.4</strong>	Foodstuffs brought into the home by staff must be stored in the foodstuffs fridge provided for staff in the staff room, never the specimens fridge, and outdated food disposed of. Staff must follow all food storage recommendations and observe sell-by dates scrupulously.</p> <p><strong>9.5</strong>	Fridges in Tideway Care services must be cleaned and checked at least once a month.</p> <p><strong>9.6</strong>	Staff are responsible for the safe management and disposal of waste in our accommodation-based services and supporting others to follow best practice guidance in their own homes.</p> <h2 id="_10-laundry"><a href="#_10-laundry" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 10. Laundry</h2> <p><strong>10.1</strong>	An adequate laundry service must be available to provide care that is both safe for staff and the people we support in residential services. All linen should be appropriately segregated and bagged for transport to the laundry facility in these services.</p> <p><strong>10.2</strong>	Used, soiled and fouled linen should be placed in a white bag. Soiled and fouled items should first be placed into a water soluble (alginate) bag sealed/tied and then either placed in:</p> <ul><li>a white fabric laundry bag for transport to the laundry. Contents should be emptied into the washing machine followed by the fabric laundry bag; or</li> <li>a white impermeable (waterproof plastic) bag for transport to the laundry. Empty the contents into the washing machine and dispose of the bag as offensive waste.</li></ul> <p><strong>10.3</strong>	Infected linen should be placed in a red water soluble (alginate) bag and should either be placed in:</p> <ul><li>a fabric laundry bag for transport to the laundry. Place the alginate bag into the washing machine, followed by the fabric laundry bag; or</li> <li>an impermeable bag for transport to the laundry. Place the alginate bag in the washing machine and dispose of the impermeable bag as infectious waste</li> <li>the outer bag should be labelled âinfectiousâ linen</li></ul> <p><strong>10.4</strong>	When handling soiled, fouled and infected linen, disposable gloves and apron should be worn. In a residential setting, commercial washing machines and tumble driers should be used to ensure the correct temperature for thermal disinfection is achieved. Washing processes should have a disinfection cycle in which the temperature in the load is maintained at 65Â°C for not less than 10 minutes or 71Â°C for not less than 3 minutes</p> <p><strong>10.5</strong>	When supporting someone in their own home, staff must help the person understand the best ways to manage their laundry hygienically.</p> <h2 id="_11-reporting"><a href="#_11-reporting" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 11. Reporting</h2> <p><strong>11.1</strong>	The Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR) requires an organisation to report the outbreak of notifiable diseases to the Health and Safety Executive.</p> <p><strong>11.2</strong> Notifiable diseases include: cholera, food poisoning, smallpox, typhus, dysentery, measles, meningitis, mumps, rabies, rubella, tetanus, typhoid fever, viral haemorrhagic fever, hepatitis, whooping cough, leptospirosis, tuberculosis and yellow fever.</p> <p><strong>11.3</strong>	Records of any such outbreak must be kept, specifying dates and times and a completed disease report form must be sent to the Health and Safety Executive.</p> <p><strong>11.4</strong>	In the event of an incident the Registered Manager is responsible for informing the Health and Safety Executive.
