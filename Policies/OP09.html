Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	The maintenance of good physical health of the people we support is vital to their ability to develop greater independence and for their wellbeing. We know that many people with a learning disability and or autism have a higher proportion of physical health needs than the general population.  (See <a href="/Policies/OP09Appendix01.html">Appendix 1</a> for Common health issues faced by people with a learning disability)</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	People with a learning disability and or autism should have a physical health check every year as a minimum. We will advocate for the people we support to have their annual health checks and equal access to other usual checks and screens as much as the general public, e.g. breast screening, well man clinics, etc.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	Some people may also have a mental health condition that requires them to have additional medication of which require specific monitoring. Therefore, people’s mental health and physical health needs can be both complex and interact with each other. The Rethink Abandoned Illness report 2012 states that ‘People with schizophrenia and psychosis die 15-20 years younger than everyone else,…’ and a need for services to deliver effective physical health care to people with severe mental illness by improving the training of all mental health staff as well as monitoring the delivery of routine physical health assessment and intervention. Health promotion initiatives are also a vital part of helping people live healthier lives. This policy addresses mental health in terms of wellbeing.</p> <h2 id="_2-principles"><a href="#_2-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.	Principles</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	The physical wellbeing of all the people we support will be routinely monitored by the support staff, with community healthcare professionals and GPs leading on specific monitoring and treatment as required by the individual.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	People with mental health problems may also require physical health care monitoring, as a direct result of the medication they may be taking for their mental health needs such as psychotropic medication. For example; Metabolic Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes are common in people with mental health conditions and routine physical health checks and therefore investigations for people receiving psychotropic medication will be carried out on a regular basis</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	All staff will participate in training, coaching and supervision to assist them in supporting people with physical health needs. They will be competent in assessing, support planning and reviewing people’s physical health needs.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	Health promotion initiatives are a vital part of helping people live healthier lives; the services will support health promotion events to advocate for health lifestyles.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	Annual physical health checks will be facilitated for all people we support and where required regular checks for eyes, teeth and feet, etc. this will be recorded in individual care notes and monitored by the Team Manager via audits.</p> <p><strong>2.6</strong>	Healthcare monitoring records will be accessible to all staff supporting an individual with their physical health needs and shared as far as is possible with the person being monitored.</p> <p><strong>2.7</strong>	Pain Management can be significant for some people, especially if they might find it difficult to communicate discomfort, pain and agony. Sometimes this can be expressed through behaviours that challenge. It is essential we eliminate all potential physical health issues whilst considering a person’s challenging behaviours and eliminating it through symptom management and treatment.</p> <p><strong>2.8</strong>	Some diagnosed syndromes have specific physical health issues to be aware of; staff require specific training around supporting someone with a specific health need. E.g. not effectively supporting someone with Prader Willi who has hyperphagia (excessive eating) can lead to obesity and other physical health issues like heart disease and gastric ruptures.</p> <p><strong>2.9</strong>	Joint working with healthcare professionals is critical to ensuring a person’s health needs are met; e.g. The pharmacy staff we work with can provide useful guidance on health monitoring in relation to specific medications and medication management.</p> <p><strong>2.10</strong>	Medication management good practice requires services to provide information and assist understanding of medication effects and side effects, including any concerns about physical health side effects.</p> <h2 id="_3-minimum-standards"><a href="#_3-minimum-standards" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3.	Minimum Standards</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	For people in our supported living services we will identify with them their health needs and whether they need any routine health checks. We will also record their needs for eye and dental care.</p> <p>In any residential services we provide, we will document a record of the following parameters prior to the person transferring as a baseline.</p> <ul><li>The measurements and tests to be done by care staff: Blood Pressure (BP), pulse, weight/height/BMI, abdominal girth, temperature and respiratory rate.</li> <li>Investigations to be carried out by healthcare professionals:
<ul><li>Urine analysis for protein, blood and glucose.</li> <li>Blood profile: FBC, U&amp;Es, LFTs, CK, GGT, TFTs, blood sugars, full lipid profile and any other blood tests relevant to physical conditions or prescribed medication.</li> <li>A standard ECG.</li></ul></li></ul> <p>The date of the investigations should be recorded in the person’s care record together with a copy of the results.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	Every person should have access to and details recorded for their annual health check, gender specific health screens and a health passport document to assist them in identifying their key health needs and how to support them best.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	People who are physically frail may be at high risk of poor nutrition, pressure sores, falls, incontinence, etc. It is therefore necessary to make sure they have a full suite of physical health baseline monitoring using validated assessment tools. See <a href="/Policies/OP09Appendix04.html">Appendix 4 - Procedure for Recording physical health vital signs</a>.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong>	Programme development- Where there is an identified physical health issue, there must be physical health monitoring and goals linked to the assessment, reviewed as determined by the health condition and updated if there is a change.</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong>	Where there is a sudden change in the physical presentation of the person, for example they become more confused, disorientated, start to have seizures, complain of pain etc. then an immediate physical health assessment must be undertaken by a healthcare professional.</p> <p><strong>3.6</strong>	If significant physical health changes are noted, then the medical emergency procedure should be initiated by calling the local emergency services, dialling 999 immediately. Only administer First Aid if you are qualified to do so.</p> <h2 id="_4-specialist-considerations"><a href="#_4-specialist-considerations" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.	Specialist considerations</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong> <strong>Standard Hospital Checks:</strong> If someone is going into hospital or referred to a specialist there are standard blood tests that they may require first. Having a blood test can be very distressing for many people and some may need coaching through the procedure and help to understand what might happen and why it is important for them to have a blood test. It is our role to support them to be able to attend and have a blood test if it is required. See <a href="/Policies/OP09Appendix02.html">Appendix 2</a> for details.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	They may also be required to have an Electro Cardio Gram (ECG) and may need support to be able to attend and have the procedure prior to going to their appointment.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong> <strong>Psychotropic medication</strong> - Anyone, person, prescribed psychotropic medication must have baseline tests on commencement of psychotropic medication and further monitoring as per the table in <a href="/Policies/OP09Appendix03.html">Appendix 3</a>.</p> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	All refusals to have blood tests or monitoring should be documented in the person’s records.  A Mental Capacity Assessment in relation to this should also be completed (see OP05 Mental Capacity) to ascertain if the person has capacity to consent.  If they do not, then the Best Interest Process should be followed.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong> <strong>Cardiovascular review</strong> - It is good practice every 6 months for those people with identifiable cardiovascular risk factors e.g. raised BP, male, over 55, smoke, overweight, poor diet, sedentary life style, dyslipidaemia etc to have a cardiovascular review as part of a physical health review.  However, the minimum frequency, this should be completed is once a year at the annual physical health review.  This list is not exhaustive, and a healthcare professional’s judgement should be used.</p> <p><strong>4.6</strong> <strong>Health Promotion</strong> - Issues should be addressed in the support plans for the people we support who have identified as at risk of any of the following:</p> <ul><li>Diet.</li> <li>Salt intake.</li> <li>Smoking status.</li> <li>Alcohol/substances intake including caffeine intake.</li> <li>Exercise.</li> <li>Sleep pattern.</li></ul> <p>We will access Public Health resources such as smoking cessation, social prescribing, healthy eating guidance, etc and coach the people we support about maintaining healthy lifestyles.</p> <p><strong>4.7</strong> <strong>Gender Specific Screening</strong> - Supporting people to access health screening clinics may be beneficial particularly at certain milestone ages the same as the general population. People with a learning disability are under- represented in accessing these clinics.</p> <p><strong>4.8</strong> <strong>Sexual Health</strong> – people’s sexual health is important, especially when they want a relationship with someone. We encourage staff to seek advice around someone’s sexual health needs as this is a sensitive area for many people. If someone should get pregnant it will be essential for a multiagency approach to provide the maximum support possible to the person.</p> <p><strong>4.9</strong> <strong>On-going monitoring</strong> - Parameters such as BMI, weight, blood pressure, pulse, full lipid profile, urine analysis and blood glucose should be done as part of annual cardiovascular risk assessment or more frequently as clinically indicated and recorded in the physical health section of care notes.</p> <h2 id="_5-recording-physical-health-monitoring"><a href="#_5-recording-physical-health-monitoring" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Recording Physical Health monitoring</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	Physical health monitoring forms are standardised for our services and should be used in conjunction with the relevant guidelines for nutrition, tissue viability, mobility, infection control, wound care, epilepsy, and continence.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	Where there are any physical health concerns identified through monitoring, the medical team must be informed to discuss and agree appropriate actions and interventions. This must be documented in the relevant section/s of the person’s care notes.</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <ul><li><p><a href="/Policies/OP09Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - Common health issues faced by people with a learning disability</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/Policies/OP09Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Standard hospital checks</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/Policies/OP09Appendix03.html">Appendix 3 - Antipsychotic medication and physical health checks</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/Policies/OP09Appendix04.html">Appendix 4 - Recording Physical Health and Vital Signs Procedure</a></p></li></ul></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">6/13/2019, 11:50:11 AM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
