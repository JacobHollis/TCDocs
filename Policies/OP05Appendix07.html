Introduction</h3> <p>These guidelines are to assist staff to explore with the people we support their sexuality and concerns or any issues around sex. At Tideway Care we understand the importance of supporting people with these issues. We recognize that people may feel embarrassed when discussing these areas and may have their own personal views to manage when talking to people about sexuality and sexual issues.</p> <h3 id="_2-intimate-personal-care-given-to-people-with-a-learning-disability"><a href="#_2-intimate-personal-care-given-to-people-with-a-learning-disability" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Intimate personal care given to people with a learning disability</h3> <p><strong>2.1</strong> Where intimate personal care is delivered this will always be done sensitively and appropriately. Staff will be aware of the need to maintain privacy and dignity when dealing with intimate personal care needs.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong> Intimate personal care should be delivered as identified from their needs assessment and detailed within the people we support’s programme manager. The people we support, their relative or advocate will be involved to ensure that personal care is appropriate for the specific individual.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong> The people we support, their relative or advocate will make the decision as to who offers intimate personal care and what form it will take.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong> Gender issues are significant in determining the appropriateness of the support and we will endeavor to ensure that the principle of same gender care is applied when meeting the intimate personal care needs of a people we support unless there is a specific preference contrary to this.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong> It is recognised that it is important for people we support to have positive role models of males and females. Work other than that involving intimate personal care would routinely be carried out by staff of either sex, subject to the preference of the individual people we support and the appropriateness of the individual staff member.</p> <p><strong>2.6</strong> Staff need to be aware of the risks of intimate personal care leading to sexual arousal or causing confusion. Support may be needed from a line manager if this occurs. Staff should feel safe and confident discussing these issues in supervision even if it may seem uncomfortable, it is important to maintain an open and honest dialogue.</p> <p><strong>2.7</strong> Staff should be able to identify when culture, religion and belief are significant in the lives and circumstances of people and how to take sufficient account of these issues in specific pieces of practice i.e. personal hygiene, intimate personal care, and sexual health education including contraception.</p> <h3 id="_3-exploitation-and-abuse"><a href="#_3-exploitation-and-abuse" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Exploitation and abuse</h3> <p><strong>3.1</strong> Abuse in any form is totally unacceptable. It must never be ignored or condoned in any way, whoever may be the perpetrator. It is not acceptable for staff to believe ‘it can never happen here’ or for staff to dismiss an allegation, however often it is made.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong> People with learning disabilities and or autism can be vulnerable to abuse throughout their lifetime. They may be used to obeying people who they deem to be in authority, and they may lack assertion or have poor communication skills.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong> All staff should be familiar with the local procedure for reporting abuse and the Tideway Safeguarding Policy and Guidelines.</p> <h3 id="_4-sexual-health-guidelines"><a href="#_4-sexual-health-guidelines" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Sexual Health Guidelines</h3> <p><strong>4.1</strong> All people with a learning disability and or autism are people first and have the same rights and sexual health needs as everyone else.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong> If a person we support tells a staff member of their sexual preferences (‘comes out’), this must be treated with sensitivity, tact and confidentiality by: * (a) Respecting the people we support’s confidence, unless otherwise indicated * (b) Offering support if needed * (c) Contacting outside agencies offering information, advice and appropriate resources * (d) Offering support in the people we support expresses the need to ‘come out’ to other people in their life.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong> Staff should not advise people we support about the choices and dilemmas they may face or offer advice or guidance unless they have received appropriate sexual health training.</p> <p><strong>4.4</strong> Sexual Health promotion materials and education should be made available in accessible formats for the people we support for their general health and wellbeing. Promotion of the use of condoms for example is deemed appropriate for all people we support.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong> The management of inappropriate sexualised behaviours should be treated with people’s rights and dignity in mind. If in any doubt about the best way to manage a situation it is advised there is a multiagency team approach to ensure consistency and appropriateness in the response.</p> <h3 id="_5-masturbation"><a href="#_5-masturbation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Masturbation</h3> <p><strong>5.1</strong> Masturbation is a usual sexual behaviour and people we support should not be made to feel guilty about masturbation or prevented from doing it.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong> For some people masturbation may be their main form of sexual activity, either from choice, inability or lack of opportunity to find a sexual partner. If it becomes obsessive, it can result in unintentional self-harm and this will need to be addressed. Obsessive behaviour can be a result of boredom.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong> People we support may need help to:</p> <ul><li>(a) understand that masturbation is normal, and acceptable in private</li> <li>(b) identify appropriate private places suitable for masturbation</li> <li>(c) understand that masturbation is not acceptable, either socially or legally, in public</li> <li>(d) identify public places which are not suitable for masturbation</li> <li>(e) understand that personal hygiene is important</li></ul> <p>These messages are likely to need constant reinforcement</p> <p><strong>5.4</strong> It may be necessary for staff to discuss whether masturbation is appropriate in their particular setting, for example, in a non-residential setting or in a workplace. If it is appropriate to provide a private place, there needs to be agreement and consistency on where this should be.</p> <h3 id="_6-working-with-families-and-carers"><a href="#_6-working-with-families-and-carers" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Working with families and carers</h3> <p><strong>6.1</strong> Families and carers may be very influential in the lives of people with learning disabilities. It is important to work in partnership with families, whilst keeping the person with a learning disability as the focus.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong> In practice, staff have a responsibility to:</p> <ul><li><strong>(a)</strong> ensure that there is good communication with families and carers and that their views are listened to and treated with respect, whilst remembering that the rights of the person with enduring mental health problems or learning disabilities needs to be of primary importance</li> <li><strong>(b)</strong> assume the person with enduring mental health problems or learning disabilities has the capacity to consent unless otherwise proven</li> <li><strong>(c)</strong> take seriously any issues raised by families relating to personal safety of the person with enduring mental health problems or learning disabilities by undertaking appropriate risk assessment</li> <li><strong>(d)</strong> if an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA) been appointed (this could be a welfare guardian, intervener or someone who has welfare power of attorney), consult with them about any decisions relating to the person with enduring mental health problems or learning disabilities</li> <li><strong>(e)</strong> share information on appropriate resources with the person’s family – this should always be done with the knowledge, and where possible, the agreement, of the person with enduring mental health problems or learning disabilities</li> <li><strong>(f)</strong> ensure that families and carers have access to the appropriate complaints procedures</li></ul> <p><strong>6.3</strong> Increasingly many people with learning disabilities and or autism, workers and parents will come from minority communities, some of which will have very clear views about the place of sexuality in people’s lives. Workers and parents from particular communities may have strong views on matters such as sexual orientation, masturbation, pornography and sexual relationships outside of marriage. Contraception, for example, may be unacceptable or controversial for Roman Catholics and Muslims. These views must be respected.</p> <h3 id="_7-staff-support-and-supervision"><a href="#_7-staff-support-and-supervision" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7. Staff support and supervision</h3> <p><strong>7.1</strong> Staff dealing with sexual health, sexuality and inappropriate sexualised behaviours must be aware of their own attitudes and beliefs and not place themselves in compromising situations. Staff handovers and the meetings are a good time to discuss concerns and share observations so the staff team can agree appropriate responses and approaches.</p> <p><strong>7.2</strong> Regular supervision and line management must be available for staff to discuss their concerns and seek guidance on the appropriate management of service users in these areas.</p> <p><strong>7.3</strong> All incidences must be recorded in the people we support’s electronic notes and any agreed responses and actions to be clearly outlined in their Programme Manager.</p> <p><strong>7.4</strong> Any concerns about abuse must be escalated to the management team without delay and when appropriate an incident report should be completed.</p> <hr> <h3 id="additional-information"><a href="#additional-information" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Additional information</h3> <p>Legislation, Guidance And Directives;</p> <ul><li>Relationships and Sexuality in Adult Social Care Services - CQC 2019</li> <li>Disabled lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people Briefing 13.
