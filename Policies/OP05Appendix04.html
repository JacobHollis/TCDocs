What is Alcohol Misuse?</h2> <p>Alcohol misuse means drinking excessively – more than the lower-risk limits of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption is measured in units. A unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is about: half a pint of normal-strength lager. a single measure (25ml) of spirits. See Appendix Two for further information.</p> <h2 id="_2-what-is-substance-misuse"><a href="#_2-what-is-substance-misuse" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. What is Substance Misuse?</h2> <p>Substance misuse is the harmful use of substances (like drugs and alcohol) for non-medical purposes. The term “substance misuse” often refers to illegal drugs. However, legal substances can also be misused, such as alcohol, prescription medications, caffeine, nicotine and volatile substances (e.g. petrol, glue, paint).</p> <p>Addiction is a physical and/or psychological need for a substance, due to regular, continued use. Some substances are highly addictive, others are less addictive. However, the symptoms of addiction are similar no matter which substance is used. Typical signs of substance misuse or addiction include:</p> <ul><li>Neglecting responsibilities and activities you used to enjoy (e.g. work, family, hobbies, sports, socialising)</li> <li>Participating in dangerous or risky behaviours (e.g. drink driving, unprotected sex, using dirty needles)</li> <li>Criminal problems (e.g. disorderly behaviour, drink driving, stealing)</li> <li>Relationship problems (e.g. arguments with partner/family/ friends, losing friends)</li> <li>Physical tolerance (e.g. needing more substance to experience the same effects, symptoms of withdrawal when not using)</li> <li>Losing control of your substance use (e.g. unable to stop using, even if you want to)</li> <li>Substance use takes over your life (e.g. spending a lot of time using, finding/getting drugs and recovering from the effects)</li></ul> <h2 id="_3-nice-guidelines"><a href="#_3-nice-guidelines" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3.

Mental health and substance misuse</h2> <p>Dual diagnosis is a common problem for both mental health services and drug and alcohol treatment services. It’s suggested that 30 to 50 per cent of people with mental health problems also have current drug or alcohol issues. One UK study of people with mental health problems, in a secure psychiatric unit, found a dual diagnosis rate of over 50 per cent, and another found the same was true among inpatients in acute psychiatric wards in London.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Further Reading</p> <p><a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/drugs-recreational-drugs-alcohol/dual-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIND Dual Diagnosis Guidance<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p></div> <p>##5. Treatment, Care and Support
Programmes of care include detoxification, substitute prescribing, the 12 Steps model and engagement in group such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), relapse prevention strategies and harm minimisation (e.g. needle exchange services to prevent Blood Bourne Viruses (BBVs) and daily/weekly monitored prescriptions).</p> <p>The National Treatment Agency Models of Care document was published in 2006; interestingly national guidance has not been updated since the early 2000’s except to move from a model of harm reduction and long-term treatment pathways to one which encouraged active treatment, abstinence and recovery (Commissioning for Recovery 2010).</p> <p>Drug treatment programmes were delivered across multiple agencies and across four tiers (see diagram below); keeping people in treatment and out of the criminal justice services were the success of this model. However; some felt there to be a creation of longer term dependency on services and substitute prescribing (Methadone and Subutex for example).</p> <p>Housing provision sits at Tier 1, low level support and intervention services. However; as housing providers have increased their competencies in providing care and support they are moving into providing some of the interventions in tier 2. where a person has a mixed presentation and is subject to risks of anti-social behavior because of their mental health and or substance misuse; tenancy support is vitally important.</p> <p><img src="/images/OP05Appendix04Pic1.png" alt="Substance Misuse Service Tiers" title="Substance Misuse Service Tiers"></p> <h2 id="_6-supporting-people-with-a-dual-diagnosis"><a href="#_6-supporting-people-with-a-dual-diagnosis" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Supporting people with a Dual Diagnosis</h2> <p>Many people who suffer from both mental health and substance misuse issues fall through the gaps in service provision. Mental health services can claim that they cannot help until the substance misuse has been treated and substance misuse services believe that the underlying mental health issues need addressing before they can help the person with their substance misuse.</p> <p>An integrated approach is therefore required in most cases so that both areas of health need are addressed together.
To best support someone with a previous or current history of substance misuse it is first important to understand the triggers to their substance misuse and what support works best for them. In addition, it will be important to understand their mental health needs and what impact substance misuse may have on their medication.</p> <p>When people who substance misuse have access to the substance or can create a harmful substance with everyday items they are more likely to misuse. It is therefore important to talk to them about how they can be safeguarded from access to harmful substances; even those that seem innocent substances such as nutmeg and bicarbonate of soda.</p> <h2 id="_7-guidance-the-following-maybe-helpful"><a href="#_7-guidance-the-following-maybe-helpful" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7. Guidance: The following maybe helpful</h2> <ul><li>Check if they are on substitute prescribing and how they manage this; do they need a lockable cabinet in their room to keep medications safe?</li> <li>Check if they must have frequent contact with the local drug and alcohol services and agree if they need support to attend.</li> <li>Check if they attend AA/NA or other support groups and agree if they need support to attend.</li> <li>Check whether they are concerned about others knowing they are in the community who may be a negative influence on them - how can they be supported to minimise concerns?</li> <li>Check if a tenancy sustainment contract will be useful to them; they may have worked with a contractual arrangement in treatment before. Talk them through what a tenancy sustainment contract would look like and discuss the circumstances which may lead to their eviction. See Appendix Four for a suggested format.</li> <li>Check if they need support in taking prescribed medications which may include Acamprosate (deters people from drinking alcohol) and Naltrexone (inhibits the action of opioids and can also be used for deterring people to drink alcohol).</li> <li>Discuss with them access to alcohol / harmful substances and how together you can reduce access and prevent triggers to using. Talk about whether there are any everyday items they misuse and agree actions to be taken if staff observe them in their accommodation. Discuss when it would be necessary to involve the police if illicit substances are found.</li> <li>What are their interests and what do they want to achieve to increase their self esteem, confidence and</li> <li>What are their important relationships? Do they have people they have alienated since their substance misuse and they want to re-engage with and rebuild trust? Do they have children they want to build a relationship with? How can they be supported to achieve this?</li> <li>What are their employment aspirations? Do they need to attend training? Will they look at volunteering or lead on a social activity for the benefit of the community, like a football five a side tournament?</li> <li>Start to look at their support plans together and emphasise the importance of them being as active and involved as possible in the community to build their confidence.</li> <li>Find out what works best to minimise harm if they become under the influence of alcohol or illicit drugs; do they respond best to being isolated and left to sleep it off or do they like to walk it off or eat a meal to reduce the effects?</li> <li>What is their crisis and contingency plan? Seek to ensure any Managing Concerns Support Plan is jointly owned between the person, the staff team and the community teams.</li></ul> <h2 id="_8-managing-concerns"><a href="#_8-managing-concerns" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 8. Managing Concerns</h2> <p>Managers should make certain regular staff supervision and debriefs are held following incidents</p> <ul><li>Developing a positive relationship with your local drug and alcohol services, local community support officers and the police will be beneficial to share knowledge, training and experience; helping them understand tenancy support and how housing works could be of benefit to them because being able to access housing is important to them and their service users.</li> <li>The misuse of substances can increase when someone is becoming unwell again and experiencing worrying symptoms, stress and anxiety can have a big impact on health and wellbeing too. Therefore, is someone ‘relapses’ it may be an indicator that they are becoming unwell again. Seek assistance from the Clinical teams to review medication and symptom management.</li> <li>Many services will not see people under the influence of drugs or alcohol; it may be better to support someone to an appointment when they are sober and postpone the appointment.</li> <li>If you arrive to support someone who is clearly unable to communicate positively with you and appears under the influence; check safety issues and withdraw from the premises stating when you will return when they are likely to be sober. Report any safety / risk issues immediately to the relevant people.</li> <li>If there is a pattern of drinking alcohol in the evenings for example; you may be better to visit in the afternoon when they have slept off the alcohol.  However, check the person does not have an associated history of self harm with substance use as it might be better to intervene much earlier.</li></ul> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Further Reading</p> <p><a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg115/chapter/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NICE Guidelines - Alcohol-use disorders: diagnosis, assessment and management of harmful drinking and alcohol dependence<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p></div></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">2/21/2019, 5:16:32 PM</span></div></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
