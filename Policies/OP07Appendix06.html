Assuming capacity, therefore, means starting from the premise that a person has capacity to make their own decisions about their care and support. It should never be assumed that a person lacks capacity solely because of their age or medical condition.</p> <p>Mental capacity is ‘decision-specific’. A person may have capacity to make decisions about some aspects of their care and support and not others. Care providers must obtain consent to each element of the care plan where the person is able to give it (consent is considered in more detail in the section Care planning, liberty and autonomy). For example, the person may be able to make their own decisions in relation to their personal care, but not about their finances.</p> <p>When providing care and support, staff should consider whether the person has the capacity to make the specific decision at the time that it needs to be made. Asking this question protects the person from blanket assumptions of a lack of capacity.</p> <p><strong>What to look for in the care and support plan and other records</strong></p> <ul><li>Evidence of the person’s informed consent to their care and support; or</li> <li>Evidence of why the person was assessed as lacking the capacity to consent</li></ul> <p><strong>Principle 2: do not treat a person as unable to make a decision unless you have done all you practically can to help them reach that decision.</strong> It would be unlawful to say that a person lacks capacity if you have not tried to support them to make a given decision. We all need advice and support at different times of our lives, for example, when buying a house or making complex financial decisions. If we seek advice we want information conveyed to us in a way that we are able to understand to help us reach our own decision. This applies equally to people in need of care and support.</p> <p>Before concluding that a person lacks capacity, care staff must do all they reasonably can to help them understand the choices they have about their care and support (this is discussed further in the section Care planning, involvement and person-centred care). By maximising a person’s capacity, they are empowered to maintain control as far as they are able, and unnecessary interventions in their lives can be avoided.</p> <p><strong>What to look for in the care and support plan and other records</strong></p> <ul><li>A description of any special communication needs</li> <li>How the person is supported to understand and be involved in decisions about their care and support
This includes the nature of the decision, the options available and the consequences of each decision.</li></ul> <p><strong>Principle 3: unwise or eccentric decisions don’t of themselves prove lack of capacity.</strong> Choices are influenced by an individual’s values, preferences and lifestyle. Staff must not impose their values on people for whom they provide care and support. Everyone has a right to pursue choices that others may consider unwise – for example, eating unhealthy foods, engaging in dangerous sports, buying lottery tickets, etc. This right does not diminish simply because a person uses care services. A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because this decision is considered unwise.</p> <p><strong>What to look for in the care and support plan and other records</strong></p> <ul><li>Information about what is important to that person, their wishes and preferences</li> <li>What the person would like to achieve from their care and support</li> <li>A person’s social history, including any key events or achievements</li> <li>If the person appears to lack capacity to make a specific decision for themselves at the time it needs to be made, an assessment of capacity should be made in relation to that particular decision</li></ul> <p><strong>Principle 4: if you are making a decision for, or acting on behalf of, a person who lacks capacity, you must do so in their best interests.</strong> The ‘best interests’ principle only applies if the person is unable to make the decision after being given all necessary support (see Principle 2). With the best intentions, care providers may on occasion act or make a decision that they consider to be in a person’s best interests before establishing whether or not that person has capacity to make their own choices. This is unlawful and deprives a person of their basic human right to freedom and autonomy.</p> <p>Any decision made on behalf of someone who lacks capacity to make it for themselves has to have regard to the ‘best interests’ checklist (set out in Section 4 of the MCA). This applies to all decisions about care, treatment and support, except where there is an advanced decision to refuse treatment (see chapter 9 of the Code) or in cases of research (see chapter 11 of the Code).</p> <p>Social and health care professionals sometimes make the mistake of conflating their ‘duty of care’ with a paternalistic approach of doing what they believe to be in a person’s best interests. Yet we know that putting people in the driving seat of their care and support dramatically improves outcomes. [7] In practice, this means paying attention to what the person wants from their care and support plan rather than the professional taking control. Care staff should always question whether their own value judgements are influencing the decision-making process. [8]</p> <p><strong>What to look for in the care and support plan and other records</strong></p> <ul><li>How the person’s liberty and choices about their care and support are promoted</li> <li>Information about the person’s views</li> <li>How the person was supported to be involved in the decision about their care and support. This includes keeping them informed about any decisions made about them</li> <li>Information against each element of the ‘best interests’ checklist (see the section in this report on Demonstrating best-interests decision-making)</li></ul> <p><strong>Principle 5: look for the least restrictive option that will meet the need.</strong> When making a best-interests decision about a person’s care and support plan, providers must consider all of the options and then choose the one that meets the need and is the least restrictive of the person’s rights and freedoms. Staff should always challenge themselves to consider whether there could be an alternative option that is less restrictive, but nevertheless meets the identified need.</p> <p>What to look for in the care and support plan and other records</p> <ul><li>Details of the options that were considered together with the associated risks and benefits of each</li> <li>A clear explanation of why a particular option was decided upon</li> <li>If restrictions are imposed, when these will be reviewed and how</li></ul></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/8/2018, 3:38:46 PM</span></div></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
