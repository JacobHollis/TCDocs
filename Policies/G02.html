Introduction (Tideway Care’s Equality Statement)</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care operates within the principles and the practice of the Equality Act 2010 by providing a culture of respect and dignity and actively challenging discrimination.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	We will maintain the right environments for our leaders, managers, employees and the people we support to demonstrate the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion in their everyday activities, roles and functions.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	We will ensure that Tideway Care will put in place the systems and processes to reduce the likelihood of any unlawful discrimination, harassment and victimisation and other conduct prohibited by the Equality Act and we will assess all of our policies and procedures to ensure they do not have an adverse effect on equality.</p> <h2 id="_2-principles"><a href="#_2-principles" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Principles</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	Tideway Care is committed to creating an organisation that actively promotes equality of opportunity for all and ensuring that no-one receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of their age, disability, gender, gender identity, marital or civil partnership status, maternity or pregnancy status, race (including nationality or culture), religion or belief, sexual orientation or caring responsibilities in any aspect of their employment.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	Our purpose is to have an environment in which people feel valued; are treated fairly and with dignity and respect at all stages of their employment or care.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	Embedding our core values and behaviours that include treating others as we would wish to be treated ourselves.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	We are strongly opposed to all forms of discrimination and victimisation.  We expect our staff to treat each other and all people we support, visitors and colleagues with dignity and respect, in a non-discriminatory manner and in accordance with their individual needs. See <a href="/Policies/G02Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Definitions</a>.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	Our delivery model is based on a model of inclusion, respect, coproduction, individuality and positivity.</p> <h2 id="_3-roles-and-responsibilities"><a href="#_3-roles-and-responsibilities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Roles and Responsibilities</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	The Managing Director, supported by the Senior Management Team is responsible for ensuring the effective implementation and management of this policy</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	The Operations Director is responsible for:</p> <ul><li>Leading the management of equality and diversity within Tideway Care, and modelling behaviours that support the implementation of this policy</li> <li>Ensuring that Tideway care publishes and reports on equality issues relating to employment and services as required by equality legislation and healthcare regulatory bodies</li> <li>Ensuring the communication of the policy within the Tideway Care services</li> <li>Ensuring the provision of appropriate training through which staff and managers are made aware of equality and diversity issues and of their responsibilities in relation to colleagues, the people we support, visitors and the wider community</li></ul> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	All employees are responsible for:</p> <ul><li>Acting in ways that are in accordance with this policy and with Tideway Care values</li> <li>Acting fairly and compassionately</li> <li>Treating other people as individuals and responding to their needs</li> <li>Respecting others’ privacy and dignity</li> <li>Ensuring they do not discriminate against, harass or intimidate others or encourage other people to do so</li> <li>Using communication methods that other people understand when carrying out duties</li> <li>Taking account of their own behaviour and its effects on others</li> <li>Undertaking relevant equality and diversity training</li> <li>Informing their manager or a member of the senior management team if they become aware of any behaviour that undermines equality and diversity</li></ul> <h2 id="_4-practical-guidelines"><a href="#_4-practical-guidelines" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Practical Guidelines</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong> <strong>Protected Characteristics</strong>
The equality act defines nine protected characteristics that people may or may not have. Note that these characteristics apply to everyone and therefore everyone is protected by the law from being unfairly treated because of these.</p> <p>The protected characteristics are:</p> <ul><li>Age</li> <li>Disability</li> <li>Gender reassignment</li> <li>Marriage and civil partnership</li> <li>Pregnancy and maternity</li> <li>Race</li> <li>Religion or belief</li> <li>Sex</li> <li>Sexual orientation</li></ul> <p>It is against the law to discriminate, harass or victimise anyone based on one of the above characteristics. Tideway Care will go above and beyond this statement and mandate that it is unacceptable to discriminate against a person based on anyone’s personal prejudices and preferences whether they relate to protected characteristics or not. We will apply rigour and scrutiny to our recruitment processes and monitoring of staff performance.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	Kinds of discrimination
Discrimination, as defined by the equality act can be divided into four types:</p> <ul><li><strong>Direct Discrimination</strong> – This is treating one person worse than another because of a protected characteristic.</li> <li><strong>Indirect Discrimination</strong> – This can happen when a policy or rule is put in place that has a worse impact on people with a particular protected characteristic than someone without one</li> <li><strong>Harassment</strong> – This means treating someone in a way that violates their dignity or creates a hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.</li> <li><strong>Victimisation</strong> – This means treating someone unfairly because they are taking action under the equality act</li></ul> <p>Everyone in the service should be aware of the different forms discrimination can take and be mindful of their actions and how they might be perceived. Not all discrimination is deliberate or malicious, but even so it is still discrimination. For example, when making a joke you should consider if anyone else might be offended by it first, even if your intentions are not to offend.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong> <strong>What to do if you think you or someone you know has been discriminated against:</strong>
If you have any concerns about someone being discriminated against or experience discrimination yourself then report it to your line manager and or a senior manager. Remember:</p> <ul><li><p>If you feel discriminated against by a colleague report this to your line manager who will undertake an initial investigation</p></li> <li><p>If you feel discriminated against by your line manager, report this to their line manager if you feel unable to resolve this with them. They will then make and initial investigation. Use the whistleblowing process (see HR01 – Employment) if you prefer to be anonymous, your concerns will be taken seriously and investigated</p></li> <li><p>If you feel someone we support is being discriminated against and it is having a significant impact on their wellbeing; report it immediately to your line manager and if they do not respond, report it to their line manager or one of the Senior Management Team. This may be a safeguarding issue and your line manager will agree with you whether it requires reporting to safeguarding and logged on Tideway Care Incident reporting system</p></li> <li><p>If you feel someone we support is being discriminated against and it is having little or no impact on their wellbeing; we expect you to still report it immediately to your line manager and discuss in team and review meetings. This may be a safeguarding issue and your line manager will agree with you whether it requires reporting to safeguarding and logged on Tideway Care Incident reporting system</p></li> <li><p>If you feel someone we support is being discriminated against by community services or peers, discuss this with them and their family at the earliest opportunity to find out what is happening and what the impact is. If you have continuing concerns report to your line manager and discuss next steps. This may be a safeguarding issue and your line manager will agree with you whether it requires reporting to safeguarding and logged on Tideway Care Incident reporting system</p></li></ul> <h2 id="_5-implementing-the-policy"><a href="#_5-implementing-the-policy" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Implementing the Policy</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	To achieve the implementation of this policy, Tideway care will:</p> <ul><li><p>Undertake equality monitoring for starters, leavers, grievance and disciplinary hearings, this data will be used to understand any trends or patterns that indicate potential or actual discrimination or gaps in the way we support our staff</p></li> <li><p>Consult widely about how our services and employment practices could be improved with our staff, the people we support and their families. We will learn from feedback and improve what we do</p></li> <li><p>Assess the impact of current and proposed policies, practices and services using Equality Impact Assessments to ensure compliance with the Equality Act and prevent potential for discrimination or disadvantaging a person or persons</p></li> <li><p>Promote Equality and Diversity training amongst staff following mandatory training as part of induction to ensure we embed the principles and intent of this policy in the delivery of management processes and supporting people</p></li> <li><p>Use corporate Equality Champions to promote and raise awareness of equality</p></li> <li><p>Publish an Annual Equality Workforce Statistics Report to the Tideway Care Senior Management Team</p></li> <li><p>Promote Tideway Care’s Equality Statement in all our staff fora and policy implementation plans</p></li> <li><p>Review the feedback we receive from the people we support and their significant others in their views on how well we implement this policy within our surveys and audits</p></li></ul> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	Implementation of this policy will be monitored by the Governance, Quality and Performance Committee and others reviewing the application of employment policies by protected characteristic in line with the requirements of the Equality Act 2010</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <ul><li><p><a href="/Policies/G02Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - Legislative Framework</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/Policies/G02Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Definitions</a></p></li></ul> <hr></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/7/2018, 10:57:29 AM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
