The Contractors employees working on Tideway Care contracts must also have undertaken appropriate and up to date training to include:</p> <ul><li>being aware of the importance, and their responsibility in appropriately sharing their concern where they are worried that a child, young person or vulnerable adult may be suffering, or at risk of, abuse;</li> <li>being aware of how to report concerns when concerned about the behaviour of a colleague/member of staff;</li> <li>understanding and being able to implement safe working practices for individual workers;</li> <li>knowing who in their organisation has safeguarding lead responsibility.</li></ul> <p>To ensure the safety of the people we support the Contractor must ensuring that all personnel working on the contract comply with the guidelines below.</p> <ul><li><p>It is the responsibility of all adults to safeguard and promote the welfare of children and vulnerable adults. The Contractor is asked to ensure that any person directly employed by them or through a subcontractor agrees to comply with the following:</p></li> <li><p>Work safely and take responsibility for own actions and behaviour.  Avoid any contact which would lead any reasonable person to question your motivation and intentions</p></li> <li><p>NEVER give your personal contact details to customer, including your mobile phone number.  Contact via social network sites is also unacceptable</p></li> <li><p>Work and be seen to work in an open and transparent way</p></li> <li><p>Stay within the agreed work area and access routes</p></li> <li><p>Obtain permission if you need to go outside the agreed work area or access routes from a representative for the site undergoing works.</p></li> <li><p>Keep staff informed of where you are and what you are doing</p></li> <li><p>Do not use profane or inappropriate language</p></li> <li><p>Dress appropriately, i.e. dress in a way that:</p> <ul><li>Is unlikely to be viewed as offensive, revealing or sexually provocative</li> <li>Does not distract, cause embarrassment or give rise to misunderstanding</li> <li>Is absent of any political or contentious slogans</li> <li>Is not considered to be discriminatory and is culturally sensitive</li></ul></li></ul> <p>REMEMBER: Your actions, however well intended could be misinterpreted.  Be mindful of the need to avoid placing yourself in vulnerable situations</p> <p><strong>Identification</strong>: A suitable means of identification should be provided by all contractors/sub- contractors and be agreed and produced for checking by the site administrator in advance of any works taking place. If a contractor fails to produce such ID they shall be refused entry to the site</p> <p>The means by which any contractorsâ€™ staff are to be identified will be determined in each case to suit the location and nature of the work being undertaken. Typical methods may include: ID badges with photo ID.</p> <h3 id="disclosure-and-barring-service-referral"><a href="#disclosure-and-barring-service-referral" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Disclosure and Barring Service Referral</h3> <p>All employees who work unsupervised with children or adults with care and support needs will have undergone a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check at the time of recruitment into the role.</p> <p>As an employer of people working with adults with care and support needs and children, we have a legal duty to make a referral to DBS in certain circumstances.</p> <p>A referral to the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) can only be made once facts have been established and an investigation has been carried out.</p> <p>We MUST make a referral to the Disclosure and Barring Service if an employee is removed from activity with customers (whether we have asked them to, or they have chosen to remove themselves) because they caused harm or pose a risk of harm to a child or adult with care and support needs.</p> <p>We MAY make a referral to the Disclosure and Barring Service if we do not remove an employee, or cannot (for example, if they have already left the organisation and are no longer employed by us), but we still have safeguarding concerns about the person.</p> <p>Full guidance on the DBS referral process can be found on the Government website. The Government also provides guidance on Harm and Risk of Harm which may help you in the discussion about whether an employee poses a risk.</p> <p>Any referral to the Disclosure and Barring Service can only be made with the authorisation of the Operational line management involved.</p> <h3 id="employee-implicated-as-perpetrator"><a href="#employee-implicated-as-perpetrator" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Employee Implicated as Perpetrator</h3> <p>If a Tideway Care employee has been named or identified as a possible perpetrator in a safeguarding concern, the ongoing owner of the enquiry must be the line manager of the employee implicated. If the employee is an agency employee, the Team Manager is responsible for liaising with the agency.</p> <p>The Operations Director must be made aware of any safeguarding concern naming an employee, so that they can support the service.</p> <p>All allegations remain unproven until a full investigation has been carried out.</p> <p>Managers must consider the potential for any safeguarding concern to be escalated to the police or result in disciplinary action later. Therefore, extreme care should be made in recording all details accurately, including date/time and names of individuals.</p> <p>Managers must not discuss details of the concern/enquiry with other employees in the team unless they have been directly involved or named witnesses.</p> <p>A high level of confidentiality must be maintained with matters relating to employees.</p> <p>The Operations Director must be contacted for advice and guidance and will support with carrying out a full investigation.</p> <p>Employees implicated in a safeguarding concern must be provided with support through the process by Human Resources and line management. Employees must also be given guidance on other supporting organisations available to them, such as unions and independent legal advice, and counselling help lines.</p> <p>Immediate consideration should be made to removing the employee from their role. Any decision to do this should consider the safety and wellbeing of customers and employees at the location. A decision to remove an employee from their role is not a presumption of guilt.</p> <p>Where a decision is made to remove an employee from their role, this could include asking the employee to: - go home/remain home for a short time (for example, until the next shift/day) - work at another location for a short time - work at an administration office for a short time.</p> <p>Any decision to remove an employee from their role must be made in conjunction with the Operations Director. Where a decision is made for the employee to remain working at a location, managers should consider whether the employee should be shadowed/supervised whilst working.</p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/8/2018, 3:38:46 PM</span></div></div> <!----> </div> <!----></div></div>
