PBS Ethos</h3> <p><strong>The Following</strong> explain our ethos embedded within our PBS Framework and model of support:</p> <ul><li><p>Labelling people is often counter-productive, it may limit communication</p></li> <li><p>Challenging behaviours are legitimate; they have a purpose and meaning which can be a communication of distress, sensory needs, social attention, social avoidance amongst others.</p></li> <li><p>Containing behaviours or restricting someone to prevent them from harm without addressing the cause is unhelpful; it does not address the cause of the person’s communication and emotions.</p></li> <li><p>All people respond to positive affirmation and rewards and giving people the necessary tools to achieve their goals can be best achieved by positive interventions and interactions.</p></li> <li><p>All people respond to punishment and neglect by evoking a negative emotional response usually withdrawal or aggression as the extremes of the scale; therefore building positive relationships strengthens the persons emotional responses.</p></li> <li><p>Trauma is a profound negative experience that can result in a range of negative behaviours which may be used as a coping strategy and become entrenched; such behaviours include: self harm, self loathing, passivity, apparent lack of emotion, fear and aggression. Relationships can deteriorate, carers are seen as threats and trust is difficult to maintain.</p></li> <li><p>The PBS methodology and structure assists us to recognise and understand the meaning and purpose of the negative behaviour and provide focussed support and interventions based on a psychological formulation .</p></li> <li><p>The PBS Programme is a step by step guide that helps the service user express what helps them and allows staff to focus on what works. It encourages an optimistic outlook using the positive interventions.</p></li> <li><p>Everyone is treated as an individual and the team help each individual express the essence of themselves and clarify their preferences.</p></li> <li><p>We adapt to our service users, we do not expect our service users to adapt</p></li></ul> <h3 id="_2-capable-environments"><a href="#_2-capable-environments" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Capable Environments</h3> <p>Development of capable environments requires both an explicit cultural values base and framework to guide and support quality practice. The following factors can be identified as leading to the delivery of capable environments.</p> <h4 id="understanding-the-relationship-between-‘challenging-behaviour’-and-the-environment"><a href="#understanding-the-relationship-between-‘challenging-behaviour’-and-the-environment" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>Understanding the relationship between ‘challenging behaviour’ and the environment</strong></h4> <blockquote><p>“<strong>Challenging behaviour is socially constructed; it is the product of individual and environmental factors interacting together. Individual factors are the characteristics people bring with them – the severity of their learning disability, the presence of additional sensory or motor disabilities, mental health problems, communication difficulties, their personal history of relationships and experiences and so on. Environmental factors are the characteristics of services – the number, training and experience of staff, how they work with the people they serve and with each other, the quality of the material environment and the opportunities it presents</strong>” (Mansell, 2007)</p></blockquote> <ul><li>This policy gives equal emphasis to creating ‘capable environments’ as it does to constructive individualised interventions for behaviours described as complex and challenging.</li></ul> <h4 id="a-primary-focus-on-wellbeing-and-quality-of-life-for-the-people-we-support-and-our-staff"><a href="#a-primary-focus-on-wellbeing-and-quality-of-life-for-the-people-we-support-and-our-staff" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>A primary focus on wellbeing and quality of life for the people we support and our staff.</strong></h4> <p>The PERMA model is an approach to promoting psychological wellbeing. The construct was developed by Dr Martin Seligman who proposed that pursuing the goal of happiness was too ‘narrow’. The PERMA model was developed to support people to have a ‘positive human future’ and the term he uses is ‘flourish’.</p> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">The 5 domains to the PERMA model are:</p> <ol><li>Positive Emotion</li> <li>Engagement</li> <li>Relationships</li> <li>Meaning</li> <li>Accomplishment.</li></ol></div> <p>Within our adoption of this model, there is a heavy focus on engagement in meaningful activities and the development of positive relationships which are characterised by building good rapport.</p> <h4 id="a-focus-on-proactive-working-and-preventative-actions"><a href="#a-focus-on-proactive-working-and-preventative-actions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>A focus on proactive working and preventative actions</strong></h4> <p>In addition to the more commonly highlighted proactive elements of individualised behaviour programmes, proactive working requires focus on all aspects of the environment as a system.</p> <p>Ensuring adherence with contemporary guidance on PBS increases the likelihood of addressing problems before they arise. Regular service review using the PBS Academy service provider checklist ensures assessment of the following areas:</p> <ul><li>Organisational Values</li> <li>Workforce development</li> <li>Organisational Processes</li> <li>Practice Based Evidence</li> <li>Stakeholder Engagement</li></ul> <h4 id="data-use-to-inform-practice"><a href="#data-use-to-inform-practice" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>Data use to inform practice</strong></h4> <ul><li>Ensuring that data capture and use supports the maintenance of a capable and enabling environment and a culture of learning</li> <li>Data will be collected on wellbeing as well as frequency, duration and severity of challenging behaviour and the use of any restrictive practices</li> <li>See section 9 below for more details.</li></ul> <h4 id="stakeholder-engagement"><a href="#stakeholder-engagement" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Stakeholder Engagement</h4> <ul><li>Stakeholders include; the person themselves, family/carers, friends and others who know the person well such as care managers, social workers, support staff etc</li> <li>A range of stakeholders will be involved in assessments, reviews, planning and direct support</li> <li>Stakeholder feedback will be sought in a range of ways with the intent to improve practice and celebrate good practice</li> <li>Demonstrable efforts will be made to empower, engage and include stakeholders to shape the organisation</li></ul> <h4 id="cultivating-a-healthy-culture-of-care"><a href="#cultivating-a-healthy-culture-of-care" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cultivating a Healthy Culture of Care</h4> <ul><li>Cultivating healthy cultures of care is a live and iterative process. It requires active leadership across a spectrum of areas and organisational levels.</li> <li>The management guru Peter Drucker is attributed with saying: &quot;Culture eats strategy for breakfast.&quot; We are under no illusions that simply having high quality policies, strategies, procedures, training and systems will ensure a healthy culture of care. It is what people actually do, how they behave that really matters.  Healthy cultures of care must be led.</li> <li>We understand that settings providing environments ‘where control of many aspects of living is in the hands of staff and the accompanying power imbalances have, perhaps, an inherent tendency to drift towards overuse, misuse and abuse’ (Paterson et al, 2013 cited in BILD 2018) These imbalances and tendencies may lead to ‘corrupted cultures of care’</li> <li>Establishing healthy cultures of care is an active process that requires a sense purpose derived from an explicit cultural values base and framework. Leadership should focus on the development of the right skills and competencies relating to the values base and framework. ‘Culture eats strategy for breakfast, but culture gets its appetite from purpose’ anon.</li> <li>An important cultural variable linked with the support of people whose behaviour may be described as challenging is the language used by staff. The words used to describe people and incidents should be respectful, inclusive and functional</li></ul> <h3 id="_3-individualised-intervention"><a href="#_3-individualised-intervention" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Individualised Intervention</h3> <p>The NICE guidance (2015) relating to individuals with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour, highlights the evidence base for core components of PBS. These are as follows:</p> <ul><li>Functional assessment of behaviour;</li> <li>Personalised intervention, based in behavioural principles;</li> <li>Psychological interventions indicated before antipsychotic medication;</li> <li>Restrictive interventions are used as the last resort;</li> <li>Training for staff providing direct support in proactive interventions, in addition to</li> <li>high quality on-going supervision; and</li> <li>The use of routine outcome measures and periodic monitoring</li></ul> <h3 id="_4-a-functional-understanding-of-behaviour-the-4-term-contingency-–-star"><a href="#_4-a-functional-understanding-of-behaviour-the-4-term-contingency-–-star" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. A functional Understanding of Behaviour (the 4-term contingency – STAR)</h3> <ul><li>A functional understanding of behaviour is key to the development of constructive interventions for individuals.</li> <li>The function of a behaviour may be understood as the purpose that behaviour serves for an individual. All behaviour serves a purpose.</li> <li>The four-term contingency model has provided a valuable construct with regards to understanding behaviour. This model can be represented using the acronym STAR (Setting Events &gt; Triggers &gt; Actions &gt; Results). In this model letters are used to describe the following:</li></ul> <table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">Letter</th> <th style="text-align:center">Word</th> <th>Technical Term</th> <th>Summary Explanation</th></tr></thead> <tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center"><strong>S</strong></td> <td style="text-align:center">Setting Event</td> <td>Establishing <br> abolishing <br> motivating operation</td> <td>Things that sensitise us to certain triggers or motivate us to behave in certain ways. These are sometimes called slow triggers (think hunger, or sleep deprivation)</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:center"><strong>T</strong></td> <td style="text-align:center">Trigger</td> <td>Discriminative stimulus <br> Stimulus delta</td> <td>Events that appear to ‘prompt’/trigger certain behaviours. (Think of the amber light in a traffic light)</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:center"><strong>A</strong></td> <td style="text-align:center">Action</td> <td>Behaviour</td> <td>What the person actually does. (think anything a human can do)</td></tr> <tr><td style="text-align:center"><strong>R</strong></td> <td style="text-align:center">Result</td> <td>Consequence event <br> reinforcement <br> punishment)</td> <td>What happens as a result of their behaviour. (think of a nice comment from your boss, or pain from touching something hot)</td></tr></tbody></table> <ul><li>Understanding the relationship between the events that happen prior to (settings and triggers) and following (the result/consequence) a behaviour (action) is key to understanding the function of a behaviour.</li> <li>Function of a behaviour can broadly be understood by what a person gets or gets away from. Sub categories of gets or gets away from include:
<ul><li>A sensation (sensory function)</li> <li>Interaction (social function)</li> <li>An object or thing (tangible function)</li></ul></li> <li>The following diagram illustrates how this sequence of events can lead to the development of behaviour (including behaviours that challenge others)</li></ul> <p><img src="/images/STARABCFlowchart.png" alt="STAR/ ABC Flowchart" title="STAR/ ABC Flowchart"></p> <ul><li>Understanding what motivates/drives behaviour and what function it serves is key in delivering positive behaviour support.</li> <li>Poor quality of life / wellbeing can act as a setting event for challenging behaviour. The TC model of PBS ensures priority focus is given to the wellbeing of individuals.</li></ul> <h3 id="_5-person-centred-approaches-wellbeing"><a href="#_5-person-centred-approaches-wellbeing" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Person Centred Approaches &amp; Wellbeing</h3> <ul><li><p>One of the main aims of positive behaviour support is to improve quality of life. Simply stated, PBS is a framework to help support people to have a good life.</p></li> <li><p>Person Centred Approaches are about discovering and acting on what is important to a person and what is important for them and finding the balance between them. It is a process of continual listening and learning, focusing on what is important to someone now and in their future, and acting on this.</p></li> <li><p>The listening is used to understand a person’s capacities and choices. Person Centred Approaches form a basis for problem solving and negotiation to mobilise the necessary resources to pursue a person’s aspirations.

Journal</h3> <p>The journal allows staff to record the pertinent information from each shift and consists of two main sections:</p> <ul><li>Data record: A section to capture data on the frequency and duration of activities and behaviour. This section can be individually tailored to reflect those activities and behaviours deemed most important. It is also possible to link this section to specific areas of an individual’s positive behaviour programme.</li> <li>Descriptive account : A section to provide a commentary on the significant events from each shift</li></ul> <ol start="9"><li>Incident Analysis System (IAS)</li></ol> <ul><li>The IAS includes three types of recording format and a computer-based collation and analysis system. The framework is an ongoing form of Indirect Functional Behaviour Assessment:</li></ul> <p>i)	<strong>Antecedent – Behaviour – Consequence (A-B-C) record</strong>: Used to collect contextual information on lower severity behaviours. May be used as a temporary or permanent measure.</p> <p>ii)	<strong>Incident Report (IR)</strong>: Used to collect detailed contextual information on incidents of higher severity. Used as a standard ongoing measure.</p> <p>iii) <strong>Serious Incident Debrief</strong>: Used to debrief with staff after serious incidents. Functions as a further analysis tool and to provide both the staff and the individual post incident support.</p> <ul><li>Information from the IAS can be transferred to a computer-based collation system that allows for trends and patterns in the data to be identified. Individual variables such as time, duration, location and antecedent – behaviour – consequence relationships can easily be pinpointed and illustrated.
