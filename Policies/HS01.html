Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care believes the health and safety of our staff and the people we support are of utmost importance and have put in place the governance to check we are maintaining the highest of standards in health and safety.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	Maintaining the health and safety of the people we support in their own homes can be a challenge and we seek to get the right balance between the application of our obligations to adhere to the legal safety requirements and the people we support’s personal wishes, choices, personal circumstances and abilities.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	We have a responsibility to maintain the people we support’s independence, privacy and personal choice whilst maintaining a safe living environment and a safe working environment for staff. We will seek to provide guidance and help to identify hazards and reduce risks in a reasonable and proportionate manner.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>	The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 requires Employers:</p> <ul><li>To prevent accidents and cases of work-related ill health and provide adequate control of health and safety risks arising from work activities</li> <li>To provide adequate training to ensure staff are competent to do their work</li> <li>To engage and consult with staff on day-to-day health and safety conditions and provide advice and supervision on occupational health</li> <li>To implement emergency procedures - evacuation in case of fire or any other significant incident</li> <li>To maintain safe and healthy working conditions, provide and maintain plant, equipment and machinery, and ensure safe storage / use of substances</li> <li>To ensure accidents and ill health at work are reported under RIDDOR: (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations</li></ul> <p><strong>1.5</strong>	The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 1989 has responsibility for ensuring that medicines and medical devices are effective and acceptably safe. You should be aware that MHRA asks healthcare workers, carers, patients and members of the public to report adverse incidents involving medical devices.</p> <h2 id="_2-management-of-health-and-safety"><a href="#_2-management-of-health-and-safety" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2. Management of Health and Safety</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong> <strong>Health and Safety Risk Assessment</strong>:  The prevention of harm is key to achieving good health and safety practice. The potential for harm will differ to each situation and risk will vary depending on a set of circumstances which we may or may not be able to predict. It is therefore important to identify all possible hazards and risks through a thorough risk assessment. (see <a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix02.html">Appendix 2</a> for the H&amp;S risk assessment tool.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	The things to consider for each risk will be:</p> <ul><li>fully describing the risk</li> <li>what needs to be put in place to prevent harm?</li> <li>who will be responsible for implementation?</li> <li>who will be responsible for checking?</li> <li>how often will it need reviewing?</li></ul> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	Our risk assessments and management plan will be undertaken and completed by the Operations Director and checked by the Senior Management Team. The assessments will be reviewed annually, when we learn from an incident and when we introduce new services as a minimum.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong> <strong>Health and safety audits</strong>: There are a number of health and safety audits we will undertake to check we remain compliant with our legal obligations around health and safety. Each audit will be designed in consultation with staff and the people we support.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	We have developed an easy read checklist for the people we support to check their health and safety at home.</p> <p><strong>2.6</strong>	As far as is possible, we will involve our staff and the people we support in our health and safety audits.</p> <p><strong>2.7</strong>	Both the assessments and audits will be shared with the Governance, quality and performance committee and the Senior Management Team when completed for sign off.</p> <h2 id="_3-incident-reporting"><a href="#_3-incident-reporting" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Incident Reporting</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	All health and safety incidents must be reported on the Tideway Care incident reporting system (see <a href="/Policies/OP03.html">OP03 - Incidents</a>); this includes near misses or any concerns regarding the potential for a breach of this health and safety policy.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong> <strong>Key legislation Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 (RIDDOR)</strong> - The following are reportable, if they arise ‘out of or in connection with work’:</p> <ul><li><p>The death of any person, whether or not they are at work, must be reported without delay, using the quickest means. A report must be received within ten days of the accident.</p></li> <li><p>Accidents which result in staff or a self-employed person suffering a specified injury (as defined by RIDDOR) must be reported without delay, using the quickest means. A report must have been received within ten days of the accident.</p></li> <li><p>Accidents which result in staff or a self-employed person being absent from work or unable to do their normal duties for more than seven days must be reported within fifteen days of the incident.</p></li> <li><p>Accidents which result in a person not at work (eg a patient, resident or visitor) suffering an injury and being taken to a hospital for treatment must be reported without delay, using the quickest means. A report must have been received within ten days of the accident. If an accident happens at a hospital, and the person receives a specified injury, it is the hospital’s duty to report it.</p></li> <li><p>Staff or self-employed person must report diagnoses of certain occupational diseases, where these are likely to have been caused or made worse by their work. Specified dangerous occurrences (as defined by RIDDOR), which may not result in a reportable injury but have the potential to do significant harm, must be reported without delay using the quickest possible means. A report must have been received within ten days of the incident.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	If a member of staff has an accident or have a diagnosed occupational disease potentially attributable to their work they must report this to their line manager. The Operations Director must be notified by the line manager and will report to RIDDOR as required.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong>	All incidents can be reported online at <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/riddor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.hse.gov.uk/riddor<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> but a telephone service remains for reporting fatal and specified injuries only. Call the Incident Contact Centre on <strong>0845 300 9923</strong> (opening hours Monday to Friday 8.30 am to 5 pm).</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong>	Tideway Care must keep a record of any reportable injury, disease or dangerous occurrence, these will be logged via the incident reporting system. We must also keep records of over-three-day injuries to our staff, although these are not reportable until the employee is off work for more than seven days.</p> <p><strong>3.6</strong>	All incidents will be treated the same as any other incident with reference to Tideway Care Incident Policy. The Senior Management Team have oversight over any RIDDOR incidents.</p> <h2 id="_4-moving-and-handling"><a href="#_4-moving-and-handling" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. Moving and Handling</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	Manual handling is the most common cause of injury at work and the social care sector is one of the highest risk areas for back injuries. According to the Health and Safety Executive around 50% of all accidents reported in the sector relates to the helping of people whose mobility is reduced by disability or long-term illness.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	In addition, a UNISON survey of homecare workers carried out in 2001 showed that incidents of back pain are 10% higher for homecare workers than the rest of the adult population. The survey also revealed that younger workers aged under 34 have broadly the same level of back pain as older workers. Manual handling includes lifting, lowering, pushing, pulling and carrying loads. Care workers are particularly at risk because of their exposure to work that involves the physical handling of people receiving care.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	Our staff may be expected to help the people we support</p> <ul><li>To get into and out of bed</li> <li>Into and out of the bath</li> <li>When using the toilet</li> <li>Managing the stairs</li> <li>Moving around the home.</li></ul> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	The HSE also states that – ‘Poor working environment, badly planned work methods and inadequate training increase the risk of injuries to workers.’ See <a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix03.html">Appendix 3</a> for guidance on manual handling. All staff must complete foundation training on Moving and Handling and where specific tasks are identified as requiring further training this should be provided.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong>	Where moving and handling is required to assist people we support; the staff will be provided with comprehensive coaching and training to work with them safely and will have records to guide and prompt on how to undertake manual handling of the individual.</p> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	If any manual handling is required or restrictive practices, staff should check that there is an MCA assessment and Best Interest decision recorded and follow the guidance recorded in the support documentation.</p> <h2 id="_5-equipment-safety"><a href="#_5-equipment-safety" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Equipment Safety</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	Every year there are numerous accidents to staff and residents from using work equipment in social care. Many are serious, and some are fatal. Ensuring that our staff are competent to do the job safely and use appropriate, well maintained equipment can prevent accidents.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	Generally, any equipment used by staff at work comes under the requirements of Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (PUWER). This places duties on employers and equipment providers, who own, operate or have control over work equipment. In a care home, this not only includes equipment used in kitchens, laundries, gardens and workshops; it also includes equipment provided for care, including bed rails, hoists, slings, electric profiling beds, thermostatic mixing valves and medical equipment.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong>	Lifting equipment and accessories, such as slings, should be uniquely identifiable. Manufacturers often label slings with a serial number, although these can fade over time, or during laundering. While it is fine to write on the label, be careful of using some permanent markers on the fabric and load-bearing webbing of slings because markers may contain solvents that can weaken the fabric. Attaching an identifying label (e.g. by using a robust cable tie) is acceptable, but labels should not be sewn onto the sling fabric as this can also weaken it. If in doubt, contact your supplier/manufacturer.</p> <p><strong>5.4</strong>	The Team Manager will keep records of thorough examinations and instruct staff to check that equipment is within date of examination before use. They will also be responsible for checking that lifting equipment and accessories are inspected at suitable intervals to check for any damage, wear and tear and faults.</p> <p><strong>5.5</strong>	Routine maintenance typically involves checking and replacing worn or damaged parts, lubrication, and making routine adjustments. This is to ensure the equipment continues to operate as intended, and risks associated with wear or deterioration are avoided. Follow the manufacturer’s guidance, especially where failure to do so might lead to harm.</p> <p><strong>5.6</strong>	Stair lifts and vertical lift platforms If stair lifts are installed in your home, residents should be assessed to see whether they are able to use them safely without assistance. Where residents require help in using a stair lift, staff should be trained in its safe use and the best way to assist the resident. Stair lifts used in a care home should comply with ISO 9386:2000 and BS 81-40:2008.</p> <p><strong>5.7</strong>	In our community services staff will be working in other people’s homes and the equipment that they may use will be risk assessed and detailed guidance on using the equipment noted in their people we support’s care notes. Staff may be required to coach and support the person to do checks for themselves and learn how to get hold of the manufacturer for faults or maintenance reviews, etc. Staff have a duty to report any concerns and advocate for the people we support to get the right equipment check and repairs completed in a timely fashion.</p> <h2 id="_6-bed-rails-–-guidance-from-the-hse"><a href="#_6-bed-rails-–-guidance-from-the-hse" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Bed Rails – Guidance from the HSE</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	Bed rails, also known as side rails or cot sides, are widely used to reduce the risk of falls.  Although not suitable for everyone, they can be very effective when used with the right bed, in the right way, for the right person. However, accident data shows that bed rails sometimes don’t prevent falls and can introduce other risks.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong>	Poorly fitting bed rails have caused deaths where a person’s neck, chest or limbs become trapped in gaps between the bed rails or between the bed rail and the bed, headboard, or mattress.  Other risks are:</p> <ul><li>rolling over the top of the rail</li> <li>climbing over the rail</li> <li>climbing over the footboard</li> <li>violently shaking and dislodging rails</li> <li>violent contact with bedrail parts</li></ul> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	Bed rails are ‘medical devices’, which fall under the authority of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). MHRA enforces the Medical Devices Regulations and the General Product Safety Regulations to ensure medical devices are acceptably safe.</p> <p><strong>6.4</strong>	When bed rails are used during the course of a work activity, such as in a care home or hospital, the employer or self-employed person providing them must ensure that they are safe.  Risks identified during inspection include:</p> <ul><li>trapping between poorly fitting mattresses and bedrails</li> <li>rolling over the top of the bedrails when overlay mattresses reduce their effective height</li> <li>trapping between the bedrail and mattress, headboard or other parts because of poor bedrail positioning.</li></ul> <p><strong>6.5</strong>	Bed rails need careful management. Users should ensure:</p> <ul><li>they are only provided when they are the right solution to prevent falls</li> <li>a risk assessment is carried out by a competent person taking into account the bed occupant, the bed, mattresses, bed rails and all associated equipment</li> <li>the rail is suitable for the bed and mattress</li> <li>the mattress fits snugly between the rails</li> <li>the rail is correctly fitted, secure, regularly inspected and maintained</li> <li>gaps that could cause entrapment of neck, head and chest are eliminated</li> <li>staff are trained in the risks and safe use of bed rails</li></ul> <p><strong>6.6</strong>	HSE advises users to take into account the dimensions in British standard BS EN 1970:2000 (to be withdrawn on 1st April 2013) and BS EN 60601-2-52:2010 when assessing risk and ensuring correct fitting. Manufacturers and suppliers of bedrails also have a duty to ensure that equipment is safe for use and you should refer to their instructions.</p> <p><strong>6.7</strong>	Most of the people we support will not require bed rails; where someone needs the support of bed rails in their own home they must be risk assessed and checked as above. The guidance for their bed rails must be detailed in their support planning records.</p> <p><strong>6.8</strong>	Any incidents in relation to bed rails must be reported immediately to your line manager and the Operations Director via phone and followed up by an email with a link to the incident report.</p> <h2 id="_7-slips-trips-and-falls"><a href="#_7-slips-trips-and-falls" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7. Slips, Trips and Falls</h2> <p><strong>7.1</strong> <strong>Definition</strong></p> <ul><li><p>A slip is to slide accidentally causing the person to lose their balance; this is either corrected or causes a person to fall.</p></li> <li><p>A trip is to stumble accidentally often over an obstacle causing the person to lose their balance, this is either corrected or causes a person to fall.</p></li> <li><p>A fall is defined as an event whereby an individual comes to rest on the ground or other lower level with or without the loss of consciousness.</p></li> <li><p>An incident defined as found on floor, is whereby the potential above activity is not witnessed but the outcome may be the same.</p></li> <li><p>Near miss prevented fall is where the interaction of another prevents the fall from happening.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>7.2</strong> <strong>Statistics</strong> tell us that:</p> <ul><li><p>Falls are among the most common and serious problems facing the older population. Falling is associated with considerable mortality, mobility, reduced functioning and can precipitate admission into long term care.</p></li> <li><p>Both the incidence of falls and the severity of fall related complications rise steadily after age 60. In the age of 65 years plus population as a whole, approximately 35% to 40% of community dwelling, generally healthy older persons fall annually.</p></li> <li><p>After the age of 75, the rates are higher. Over 200,000 people every year are admitted to hospital for treatment after a fall and up to 14,000 people a year die in the UK as a result of an osteoporotic hip fracture.</p></li> <li><p>The impact of a fall (or series of falls) often goes beyond physical pain and can lead to long term disability, anxiety, depression, social isolation and a loss of confidence.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>7.3</strong> <strong>Prevention</strong> is our aim at all times:</p> <ul><li><p>If you have an accident or a near miss, make sure you report it to your line manager promptly. They can use this information to prevent future accidents.</p></li> <li><p>If you see a spillage, clean it up or make arrangements for it to be cleaned.</p></li> <li><p>Report any damaged floors or flooring, including mats if they are a trip hazard</p></li> <li><p>Play your part and keep the workplace tidy.</p></li> <li><p>If you see items on the floor where someone could trip over them, remove them or arrange for them to be removed or for the situation to be made safe.</p></li> <li><p>If you are given PPE, wear it and look after it. Report any faults or damage to your employer and make arrangements for a replacement.</p></li> <li><p>Tell your line manager about any work situation that you think is dangerous, or if you notice that something has gone wrong with our health and safety arrangements.</p></li></ul> <p><strong>7.4</strong>	Whilst the majority of the people we support will be very mobile, some will not. If there are any falls risk these will be defined as part of the programme development process and the agreed approach to be agreed with the individual is recorded.</p> <p><strong>7.5</strong>	We will encourage people to look out for slips and trips hazards in their homes and support them to be aware of risks around their home.  See <a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix04.html">Appendix 4</a> for more guidance.</p> <h2 id="_8-hazardous-substances-infections-and-diseases"><a href="#_8-hazardous-substances-infections-and-diseases" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 8. Hazardous substances, infections and diseases</h2> <p><strong>8.1</strong>	Care workers can be exposed to infections as a result of direct contact with someone under their care who is infected or by cleaning up infected body fluids. It is important that precautions are taken at all times to reduce the risk of exposure. When dealing with blood or other bodily fluids, strict procedures should be adopted to control the possibility of infection.</p> <p><strong>8.2</strong>	Please refer to the <a href="/Policies/HS02.html">HS02 - Infection Control</a> Policy for details on the prevention of infections and diseases. Take the following precautions:</p> <ul><li><p>Always clean up spillages immediately and disinfect if it is a bodily fluid (urine, vomit, faeces, blood, etc)</p></li> <li><p>Dispose of any materials you have used for disinfecting equipment, clothing, or any other things contaminated with bodily fluids</p></li> <li><p>Wear protective gloves, apron, eye and mouth protection where a risk of splashing, when dealing with potentially contaminated body fluids and materials</p></li></ul> <p><strong>8.3</strong>	Hazardous substances include cleaning liquids, fumes, dust, materials, e.g. asbestos, etc. If in doubt, ask for advice from your line manager. We have a duty to the people we support to help them with understanding about risks to their health as a consequence of exposure to hazardous substances.</p> <p><strong>8.4</strong>	Report any concerns via your line manager and the Tideway Care Incident Reporting system immediately.</p> <h2 id="_9-legionella"><a href="#_9-legionella" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 9. Legionella</h2> <p><strong>9.1</strong>	The HSE says that: Duties under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) extend to risks from legionella bacteria, which may arise from work activities. The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations (MHSWR) provide a broad framework for controlling health and safety at work.  More specifically, the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (COSHH) provide a framework of actions designed to assess, prevent or control the risk from bacteria like Legionella and take suitable precautions.</p> <p><strong>9.2</strong>	The Approved Code of Practice: Legionnaires’ disease: The control of Legionella bacteria in water systems (L8) contains practical guidance on how to manage and control the risks in your system. As an employer, or a person in control of the premises, you are responsible for health and safety and need to take the right precautions to reduce the risks of exposure to legionella. You must understand how to:</p> <ul><li>identify and assess sources of risk</li> <li>manage any risks</li> <li>prevent or control any risks</li> <li>keep and maintain the correct records</li> <li>carry out any other duties you may have</li></ul> <p><strong>9.3</strong>	In our accommodation based services Tideway Care is responsible for checking for the risk of Legionella. However, when the people we support are a tenant, their landlord is responsible for ensuring risks are reduced as follows:</p> <ul><li>The water temperature in all or some parts of the system is between 20–45 °C</li> <li>Water is not stored or re-circulated as part of the system</li> <li>There are no sources of nutrients such as rust, sludge, scale, organic matter and biofilms</li> <li>The conditions are likely to encourage bacteria to multiply</li> <li>it is possible for water droplets to be produced and, if so, whether they can be dispersed over a wide area, e.g. showers and aerosols from cooling towers</li> <li>it is likely that any of your staff, residents, visitors etc are more susceptible to infection due to age, illness, a weakened immune system etc and whether they could be exposed to any contaminated water droplets</li></ul> <p><strong>9.4</strong>	Following a risk assessment in relation to the risk of Legionnaires; the assessor must record in the Health and Safety Folder the following details:</p> <ul><li>(a) person or persons responsible for conducting the risk assessment, managing, and implementing the written scheme</li> <li>(b) significant findings of the risk assessment</li> <li>(c) written control scheme and details of its implementation</li> <li>(d) details of the state of operation of the system, i.e. in use/not in use</li> <li>(e) results of any monitoring inspection, test or check carried out, and the dates</li></ul> <p><strong>9.5</strong>	These records should be retained throughout the period for which they remain current and for at least two years after that period. Records kept in accordance with (e) should be retained for at least five years.</p> <p><strong>9.6</strong>	Report any concerns you have about the risk of Legionella to your line manager and through the Tideway Care Incident Reporting system.</p> <h2 id="_10-hot-water-and-surfaces"><a href="#_10-hot-water-and-surfaces" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 10. Hot water and surfaces</h2> <p><strong>10.1</strong> <strong>Hot water</strong>: If hot water used for showering or bathing is above 44 °C there is increased risk of serious injury or fatality. Where large areas of the body are exposed to high temperatures, scalds can be very serious and have led to fatalities. Hot surfaces Contact with surfaces above 43 °C can lead to serious injury.</p> <p><strong>10.2</strong>	Prolonged contact often occurs because people have fallen and are unable to move, or are trapped by furniture. Incidents often occur in areas where there are low levels of supervision, for example in bedrooms, bathrooms and some communal areas.</p> <p><strong>10.3</strong>	Risk assessment of the people we support’s individual circumstances is important and should include whether they:</p> <ul><li><p>Are likely to try to run a bath or shower or add water when unattended. This is a particular issue for people whose mental capacity is impaired</p></li> <li><p>Lack of mobility which means they are unable to respond safely to hot water or surfaces (eg safely get in/out of the bath or shower, or move away from a radiator)</p></li> <li><p>Have impaired sensitivity to temperature</p></li> <li><p>Have cognitive impairment or other conditions that mean they cannot recognise or react to hot water or a surface that is too hot;</p></li> <li><p>Can summon assistance</p></li> <li><p>Have any lifting or other aids that limit mobility in the bath or elsewhere</p></li> <li><p>Have any furniture, fixtures and fittings which restrict movement away from the source of heat</p></li></ul> <p><strong>10.4</strong>	The risk of burns from hot surfaces may be reduced by:</p> <ul><li>providing low surface temperature heat emitters</li> <li>locating sources of heat out of reach</li> <li>guarding the heated areas (eg providing radiator covers, covering exposed pipework)</li> <li>reducing the flow temperatures, although this should not reduce their effectiveness or increase risk from legionella.</li></ul> <p><strong>10.5</strong>	Ensure the people we support are given information about checking the heat of appliances, tap water, radiators, etc as part of their regular home safety checks.</p> <h2 id="_11-fire-safety"><a href="#_11-fire-safety" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 11. Fire Safety</h2> <p><strong>11.1</strong>	The prevention of fire is critical to our safety; landlords are required to be compliant with legislation which is fully summarised in the link under point 3 of <a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix01.html">Appendix 1</a>. Staff may be required to act as advocates for the people we support to ensure the landlord fulfils their legal obligations for fire safety.</p> <p><strong>11.2</strong>	General fire safety hazards:  Fires need three things to start – a source of ignition (heat), a source of fuel (something that burns) and oxygen:</p> <ul><li><p>sources of ignition include heaters, lighting, naked flames, electrical equipment, smokers’ materials (cigarettes, matches etc), and anything else that can get very hot or cause sparks</p></li> <li><p>sources of fuel include wood, paper, plastic, rubber or foam, loose packaging materials, waste rubbish and furniture</p></li> <li><p>sources of oxygen include the air around us</p></li></ul> <p><strong>11.3</strong>	To eliminate the risk of fire you have to tackle these three sources, this is why it is important to help the people we support understand the risks if they hoard papers, do not check their electrical equipment, do not pay attention to putting our cigarettes, not closing windows, etc.</p> <p><strong>11.4</strong>	To help prevent accidental fires or explosions, you first need to identify:</p> <ul><li>what substances, materials, processes etc have the potential to cause such an event, ie substances that burn or can explode and what might set them alight</li> <li>the people who may be at risk/harmed</li></ul> <p><strong>11.5</strong>	Once you have identified the risks, you should consider what measures are needed to reduce or remove the risk of people being harmed. This will include measures to prevent these incidents happening in the first place, as well as precautions that will protect people from harm if there is a fire or explosion.</p> <p><strong>11.6</strong> <strong>Key points to remember</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Think about the risks of fire and explosions from the substances you use or create in the home and consider how you might remove or reduce the risks</li> <li>Use supplier safety data sheets as a source of information about which substances might be flammable and keep them safe and out of the way.</li> <li>Consider reducing the amount of flammable/explosive substances you store in the home, this should be minimal</li> <li>Keep sources of ignition (eg naked flames, sparks) and substances that burn (eg vapour, dusts) apart from each other</li> <li>Get rid of flammable/explosive substances safely</li> <li>Review your risk assessment regularly</li> <li>Maintain good housekeeping, e.g. avoid build-up of rubbish, dust or grease that could start a fire or make one worse</li></ul> <p><strong>11.7</strong> <strong>Smoking</strong>:  Remember that people have the right to choose to smoke, it is important to help the people we support who smoke to be aware of fire safety and coach them to prevent a fire. Smoking cessation advice can be accessed if they choose to have help with their smoking.</p> <h2 id="_12-work-related-violence-and-aggression"><a href="#_12-work-related-violence-and-aggression" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 12. Work related Violence and Aggression</h2> <p><strong>12.1</strong>	The likelihood of the people we support, their families and associates being violent and aggressive is potentially higher than the general population due to their vulnerability and communication challenges.</p> <p><strong>12.2</strong>	The HSE states that: Employers should ensure that they assess the risk of violence and implement measures, which will prevent or reduce this risk. See OP06 – Positive Behaviour Support for guidance around identifying and managing risks of violence. The risk of violence to home care workers who work alone should be no greater than for other workers, and alternative arrangements or additional staff to deal with high risk situations should be available.</p> <p><strong>12.3</strong>	In general, employers will need to look at all aspects of the work activities including working practices and systems of work, the area that home care workers are likely to travel to and from and work in, staffing levels, the information and training provided and reporting procedures.</p> <p><strong>12.4</strong>	They should also consider:</p> <ul><li>Avoiding the need for lone working whenever possible</li> <li>Changing the way the job is carried out</li> <li>Improving information gathering and sharing about clients or their family with a history of violence</li> <li>Identifying visits which should not be carried out by a lone home care worker</li> <li>Ensuring that managers of home care workers have details of their itinerary at all times.</li></ul> <p><strong>12.5</strong>	At Tideway Care we will risk assess each of the people we support to identify whether there is a need to avoid lone working. Additional staffing will be agreed with the funding authority as part of the planned support package and risk management plans will be reflected in the people we support’s action plans.</p> <p><strong>12.6</strong>	Our staff are trained in lone working and personal safety and positive behaviour support approaches including the management of violence and aggression. Please refer to our Lone Working Procedure.</p> <h2 id="_13-work-related-stress"><a href="#_13-work-related-stress" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 13.

We will want to ensure they are supported well.</p> <h2 id="_14-driving-at-work"><a href="#_14-driving-at-work" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 14. Driving at work</h2> <p><strong>14.1</strong>	More than a quarter of all road traffic incidents may involve somebody who is driving as part of their work at the time (Department for Transport figures). Health and safety law applies to work activities on the road in the same way as it does to all work activities. The following suggests ways you can do this. Effective management of work-related road safety helps reduce risk, no matter what size your organisation is. It could also result in, for example:</p> <ul><li>fewer injuries to drivers</li> <li>reduced risk of work-related ill health</li> <li>reduced stress and improved morale.</li></ul> <p><strong>14.2</strong>	Health and safety law does not apply to people commuting (i.e. travelling between their home and their usual place of work), unless they are travelling from their home to somewhere which is not their usual place of work.</p> <p><strong>14.3</strong>	There is also risk related to people transporting the people we support in their own cars; ensure there is a well documented risk assessment and management plan in place for the people we support who require you to transport them in your own car or escort them in someone else’s / a taxi / on public transport.</p> <p><strong>14.4</strong> See <a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix05.html">Appendix 5</a> for Car Safety Guidance and requirements.</p> <h2 id="_15-community-trips"><a href="#_15-community-trips" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 15. Community trips</h2> <p><strong>15.1</strong>	If you are escorting people, we support in the community; any risks will be assessed prior to going out on an individual basis. Any risk will be recorded in their support notes and behaviour support plans. Staff must read and understand these plans and alert their line manager if they think they should be changed.</p> <p><strong>15.2</strong>	Most community trips will be planned with the people we support and all the potential risks and how to manage them will be discussed and agreed prior to going out.</p> <p><strong>15.3</strong>	Some hints and tips:</p> <ul><li>Do not attempt to escort someone who you believe is a risk at that particular time.</li> <li>Do discuss this with your team and share your thoughts and concerns.</li> <li>Do not make promises you cannot keep about timings, duration of trips, etc this may cause unnecessary anxiety for the people we support.</li> <li>Do make sure you are prompt with your timings but also flexible if the people we support want to go earlier and it is possible to do so for example. Remember, telling someone ‘NO’ too often can lead to frustration and may lead to behaviours that challenge.</li> <li>Do make sure you understand the guidance provided in the support / behaviour support plans.</li> <li>Do ask for help and remember to document any incidents</li></ul> <h2 id="_16-first-aid"><a href="#_16-first-aid" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 16. First Aid</h2> <p><strong>16.1</strong>	All Tideway Care support staff will be trained in Basic Level First Aid and be alert to potential accidents and emergencies. The people we support may have high health needs and this will be identified upon assessment.</p> <p><strong>16.2</strong>	Please refer to the Tideway Care Physical Health and vital signs monitoring procedure for details on our approach to monitoring physical health and first aid training. Anyone deemed high risk of needing first aid will be encouraged to keep a first aid kit at home and the staff will carry a first aid kit in their car.</p> <p><strong>16.3</strong>	Remember to always call for help and only attempt to administer first aid if you have been trained and feel confident to use it.</p> <h2 id="_17-passive-smoking-at-work"><a href="#_17-passive-smoking-at-work" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 17. Passive Smoking at work</h2> <p><strong>17.1</strong> It is now illegal to smoke in any enclosed public space, as of July 1st, 2007 which includes all working environments. A man in Scotland was awarded a fixed penalty fine of £50 for smoking inside his cab, as this too is classed as a working environment. Therefore, it is Tideway Care policy that no-one may smoke in their car on Tideway Care business.</p> <p><strong>17.2</strong> There is a smoking ban on all Tideway Care residential services that we provide, and we will support both our staff and the people we support to stop smoking. If they wish to smoke they must do so off the premises.</p> <p><strong>17.3</strong> In supported living services such restrictions are not possible to enforce as it is their own home and they have freedom of choice. We cannot ban the people we support from smoking in their own home and nor should our staff expect to be consistently exposed to an environment which is harmful to their health.  A more satisfactory approach, which has been adopted by some employers is to ask the people we support not to smoke for one hour before a visit, outside as far as is possible whilst with staff and allow staff to ventilate the rooms they work in by opening the windows. It’s not a perfect solution and there may still be some exposure from residual smoke, however it’s a compromise which recognises that an individual should be allowed to take part in legal activity in their own home and respect the health of staff.</p> <p><strong>17.4</strong> Any concerns must be reported to your line manager and any incidents logged via the incident reporting system.</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <p><a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - Additional H&amp;S Resources</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Risk Assessment &amp; Manamement Plan Forms</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix03.html">Appendix 3 - Manual Handling Procedures</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix04.html">Appendix 4 - Prevention of Falls Procedure</a></p> <p><a href="/Policies/HS01Appendix05.html">Appendix 5 - Road Safety</a></p></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/7/2018, 10:57:29 AM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
