As a new member of staff, you are asked to help Adam get dressed this morning and you are worried this will upset him because he has not met you before.

Then offer to do it next time</td> <td>This may be the better option if Adam is already agitated this morning. It shows a willingness to learn and do the right thing for Adam.
