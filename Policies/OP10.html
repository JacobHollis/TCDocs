Before Conducting Any Driving for Work</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong> All staff are required to submit a <a href="/documents/OP10Appendix1-DrivingCheckForm.pdf">driving eligibility check</a> to their manager before undertaking any driving for work. This check confirms;</p> <ul><li>The driver has a valid UK Driving Licence</li> <li>The driver has valid business insurance cover for any vehicle intended to be driven for work (usually this will be their own vehicle)</li> <li>Any vehicles to be driven for work are of roadworthy status with up to date pass of the MOT test where applicable</li> <li>The driver attests that they are properly qualified and licenced to drive any vehicles covered in the above checks</li> <li>The driver discloses any driving convictions and/or accidents that have occurred in the last 5 years</li></ul> <p><strong>2.2</strong> Upon receiving the driving eligibility check, managers must confirm that all of the checks are completed and where any convictions/ accidents are disclosed managers should conduct an assessment of the impact of the disclosed information on the employee's ability to safely drive for work See Section 7.</p> <p><strong>2.3</strong> Results of the above checks will be recorded on the Employee's HR record, managers are responsible for ensuring that employees have sufficient completed checks on record before scheduling any tasks/ shifts that will involve driving for work.</p> <h2 id="_3-before-every-journey"><a href="#_3-before-every-journey" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3. Before Every Journey</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong> Consider alternative methods of transport to complete the journey. If driving is the best method of transport you should ensure your journey is properly planned and includes sufficient time for breaks that may be necessary for longer journeys.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong> Consider which vehicle you will be driving. If it is your own vehicle you should ensure you have completed all the necessary checks covered in section 2. If it is not your vehicle you must review <a href="/Policies/OP10.html#_6-before-driving-a-vehicle-other-than-your-own">section 6</a> in addition to this list before proceeding.</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong> If you are undertaking a journey with any passengers you must review the checks in <a href="/Policies/OP10.html#_5-before-taking-passengers">section 5</a> in addition to this list before proceeding.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong> Check that the vehicle is in a roadworthy condition and that you are confident that there are no mechanical faults present that might present a risk during this journey.</p> <div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Things to Check before you set off:</p> <p>This list is not exhaustive but is a useful starting point;</p> <ul><li>Lights and Windows are clean</li> <li>All lights and indicators are working</li> <li>Fuel Level</li> <li>Oil Level</li> <li>Water Level and Screen Wash level</li> <li>Tyre Pressures</li> <li>Tyre Wear levels</li> <li>The vehicle has not been damaged</li></ul></div> <p><strong>3.5</strong> Check that it is safe to drive in the current weather conditions and if there are any additional precautions you should be taking as a result of weather or other external factors.</p> <p><strong>3.6</strong> Check you are currently fit to drive and that your ability to complete the journey will not be impaired. Some things to consider include:</p> <ul><li>You should never drive under the influence of alcohol or other substances (including any prescription drugs that may impair your ability to drive safely)</li> <li>You should not be overly fatigued before setting off</li> <li>You should not attempt to drive if you are experiencing any issues that impair your vision</li> <li>You should not attempt to drive if you are feeling unwell to an extent that may impair your ability to drive safely</li></ul> <h2 id="_4-during-every-journey"><a href="#_4-during-every-journey" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4. During Every Journey</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong> Whilst driving for work you should always attempt to drive in a way that minimises the chances of any adverse events occurring.
Safe driving behaviour includes (but is not limited to);</p> <ul><li>Observing all aspects of the highway code including obeying all speed limits,  all signs and traffic signals</li> <li>Being courteous to other road users and avoiding situations that might result in 'road rage'</li> <li>Avoiding distractions whilst driving - Including not using mobile phones while driving - If you need to make a phone call you should park in a safe area first and complete your call before continuing to drive</li> <li>Remaining vigilant of your ability to drive safely. If you begin to feel tired or unwell during a journey you should stop at the earliest opportunity that it is safe to do so and allow yourself to recover before continuing</li></ul> <p><strong>4.2</strong> It is important to acknowledge that when taking passengers (including people we support) that your actions impact on their safety as well as your own and that you must pay even greater attention to maintaining the highest levels of safety.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong> When you complete a driving for work journey, take a note of mileage incurred whilst driving for work and refer to <a href="/Policies/HR03.html">HR03 - Expenses</a> for guidance about submitting expenses claims.</p> <h2 id="_5-before-taking-passengers"><a href="#_5-before-taking-passengers" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5. Before Taking Passengers</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong> Before undertaking a journey where you will be transporting other people you should first explore every other possible method of transport. Tideway Care actively encourages the use of public transport when working with the people we support wherever possible, on occasions taxis may also be appropriate. As a general rule staff should only be driving people we support when that has been properly considered by the care team and it is agreed as the most appropriate method of transport.</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong> In instances where it is deemed appropriate to drive a person we support, in addition to first ensuring the checks set out in section 2 are complete you must also ensure that a risk assessment has been completed which considers any specific risks posed by or to that person being transported in this way.</p> <p>Once a risk assessment has been completed individual members of staff must have read and understood the risk assessment before undertaking any journeys. You should ensure you feel safe to transport the passenger(s) before setting off.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong> Where risk assessments identify specific risks that may occur during transport you may decide one of the following options:</p> <ul><li>Postpone the journey, put plans in place that may address the risk(s) in the future and review the risk assessment at another time</li> <li>Agree measures with the team that address the risks - such as providing additional staff to act as an escort</li> <li>Review alternative methods of transport</li></ul> <h2 id="_6-before-driving-a-vehicle-other-than-your-own"><a href="#_6-before-driving-a-vehicle-other-than-your-own" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6. Before Driving a Vehicle Other Than Your Own</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong> In situations where you are required to drive a vehicle other than your own you should first assess whether there are any alternative methods of transport such as public transport.</p> <p><strong>6.2</strong> If it is deemed appropriate to drive the vehicle you must first ensure;</p> <ul><li>The owner of the vehicle is aware you will be driving it and you have permission to do so</li> <li>That you are properly qualified and licenced to drive the vehicle in question</li> <li>The vehicle is fit for the intended purpose and that you are properly trained and able to safely use the vehicle and any assistive equipment involved</li> <li>The vehicle is currently roadworthy and has an up to date pass on the MOT test where required</li> <li>You are insured to drive the vehicle and that any additional declarations required to be made by you, or on your behalf, have been made and properly logged</li></ul> <p>If in any doubt about whether you should drive the vehicle speak to your line manager before commencing any journeys.</p> <h2 id="_7-reportable-events"><a href="#_7-reportable-events" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7.
