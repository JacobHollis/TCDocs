Introduction</h2> <p><strong>1.1</strong>	Tideway Care advocates strongly for the people we support to have as much choice and control as possible in their decisions about how they live their lives. However, for some people their mental capacity may be such that they require others to make decisions for them and sometimes restrict what they do for their own wellbeing / safety or the safety of others.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>	We anticipate that many people we support have been cared for under the Mental Health Act (MHA) and or Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and Best Interest (BI) decision making. Some may have also been under Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) or a Ministry of Justice (MOJ) order. All these are restrictions on a person’s liberty and choices (<a href="/Policies/OP07Appendix01.html">See Appendix 1</a> for glossary of terms used in the processes and practice involved in safeguarding people we support from poor practice in care and support provision) One of the effects of this can be that the person no longer knows they have choices or rights. This can lead to increased behaviours that challenge and can prevent progress towards independence and self-responsibility.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>	We therefore advocate for a positive risk taking culture and the use of restrictions as a last resort. It is therefore necessary for all our staff to understand what is restrictive, and how imposing restrictions has to be a team decision and responsibility; except in emergency situations where retrospective checks will be made to ensure the actions were necessary.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong> <strong>The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) Key Principles</strong> - The Act is built on five statutory principles that guide and inform decision-making in respect of the estimated two million people who may lack capacity for decision making in some aspects of their life including their health care.  They are as follows.</p> <ul><li><strong>A presumption of capacity</strong> – every adult has the right to make his or her own decisions and must be assumed to have capacity to do so unless it is proved otherwise</li> <li><strong>Support individuals to make their own decisions</strong> – people must be given all appropriate help before anyone concludes that they cannot make their own decisions.</li> <li><strong>Right to make an unwise decision</strong> – people have the right to make what others might regard as an unwise or eccentric decision. Everyone has their own values, beliefs and preferences which may not be the same as those of other people. You cannot treat them as lacking capacity for that reason.</li> <li><strong>Best interest</strong> – anything done for or on behalf of people without capacity must be in their best interests</li> <li><strong>Least restrictive option</strong> – anything done for or on behalf of people without capacity should be the least restrictive.</li></ul> <p><strong>1.5</strong>	The gravity of putting restrictions in place for a person is such that we will put in robust checks and balances to ensure the legal process of MCA, MHA, BI, DoLS and MOJ orders are upheld, documented and reviewed frequently.</p> <h2 id="_2-governance"><a href="#_2-governance" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.	Governance</h2> <p><strong>2.1</strong>	We will audit documentation and practice in relation to MHA, MCA, DoLs and BI decision making on an annual basis as a minimum.</p> <p><strong>2.2</strong>	The audits will include:</p> <ul><li>Review of process documentation</li> <li>Review of people we support care notes</li> <li>Review of Practice Workshop meetings</li> <li>1-1 interviews with staff</li> <li>1-1 interviews with the people we support</li> <li>1-1 interviews with the PWS’s families</li></ul> <p><strong>2.3</strong>	The audit/s will be presented to the Senior Management Team (SMT) for consideration and recommendations for any improvements that are required.</p> <p><strong>2.4</strong>	All MCA and DoLs cases will be reviewed within the monthly practice workshops to ensure they remain relevant.</p> <p><strong>2.5</strong>	All documentation in relation to this policy will be held in the electronic records of the People we Support and accessible to the Team Manager for review / audit.</p> <h2 id="_3-deprivation-of-liberty-dols-safeguards"><a href="#_3-deprivation-of-liberty-dols-safeguards" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 3.	Deprivation of Liberty (DoLs) Safeguards</h2> <p><strong>3.1</strong>	The Deprivation of Liberty (DoLs) Safeguards within the MCA provides a legal protective framework for those vulnerable/at risk people who are deprived of their liberty and not detained under the Mental Health Act 2005.</p> <p><strong>3.2</strong>	Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights states: “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save... in accordance with a procedure prescribed in law.”</p> <p><strong>3.3</strong>	The safeguards apply to people 16 years old and above; in hospitals and homes (whether privately or publicly funded) and their purpose is to prevent arbitrary decisions that deprive vulnerable people of their liberty.</p> <p><strong>3.4</strong>	In the event of it being necessary to deprive a person of their liberty the safeguards give them rights to representation, appeal and for any authorisation to be monitored and reviewed.</p> <p><strong>3.5</strong>	People can be deprived of their liberty in settings other than hospitals and care homes such as supported living but in such cases the deprivation can only be approved by the Court of Protection and applications for authorisations in such circumstances should be made to the Court.</p> <p><strong>3.6</strong>	The MCA gives certain responsibilities to staff caring for vulnerable people who lack the capacity to consent to their care and treatment to use restriction and restraint where it is in the best interests of the person and is necessary to prevent harm.  The Court of Protection may appoint a deputy to manage the personal welfare or the property and affairs of another person, who lacks the mental capacity to manage them themselves.</p> <p><strong>3.7</strong>	If, however, that restriction and restraint moves towards depriving that person of their liberty it could be unlawful unless authorised by the relevant local authority following an assessment
process determined in law.</p> <h2 id="_4-best-interest"><a href="#_4-best-interest" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 4.	Best Interest</h2> <p><strong>4.1</strong>	When a person has been assessed as lacking capacity in relation to a specific decision, health and social care staff must ensure that any decision made on behalf of the person is made in ‘Best Interest’. When making a best interest decision staff must consider the following.</p> <p><strong>4.2</strong>	Regaining capacity – it may be appropriate to delay the decision to allow further time for additional steps to be taken to restore the person’s capacity or to provide support and assistance which would enable the person to make the decision themselves.</p> <p><strong>4.3</strong>	Encouraging participation – the person must be permitted and encouraged to participate as fully as possible in any act done for him/her and any decision affecting him/her. Time must be taken to try to seek their views. A trusted relative or friend, or an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate, may be able to help the person to express wishes or aspirations or to indicate a choice between different options.</p> <p><strong>4.4</strong>	The person’s feelings and wishes – the person making the decision must consider so far as is reasonably ascertainable, the person’s past and present wishes and feelings; the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his/her decision if he/she had capacity; and the other factors that he/she would be likely to consider if he/she were able to do so. This also includes any specific views that may have been set out in an Advance Directive, communicated informally to relatives and carers or formally in the Lasting Power of Attorney.</p> <p><strong>4.5</strong>	The views of other people – the person making the decision must take into account, if it is practicable and appropriate to consult with them, the views of anyone named by the person as someone to be consulted on the matter in question or on matters of that kind; anyone engaged in caring for the person or interested in their welfare; any done of a Lasting Power of Attorney. You may also need to consult with other professionals involved in the persons care.</p> <p><strong>4.6</strong>	Do not make assumptions – the person making the decision must not make any assumptions about the person based on age, condition, appearance or behaviour.</p> <p><strong>4.7</strong>	Reasonable Belief - Section 4(9) of the MCA 2005 confirms that if someone acts or makes a decision in the reasonable belief that what they are doing is in the best interests of the person who lacks capacity, then provided they have followed the considerations detailed above; they will have complied with the best interests principle set out in the Act. Guidance on good practice, when making significant best interests decisions on behalf of someone lacking capacity (for the relevant decision), recommends using a ‘balance sheet’ approach in weighing up the relevant factors ‘for and against’ any planned interventions.</p> <p><strong>4.8</strong>	Consider the following factors:</p> <ul><li><strong>Medical aspects</strong> - Not just the outcome, but what will be the burden and the benefit of the treatment?</li> <li><strong>Welfare aspects</strong> - How will this impact (for better or worse) on the way the person lives their life?</li> <li><strong>Social aspects</strong> - What will this do to the person’s relationships etc.?</li> <li><strong>Emotional aspects</strong> - How will this person feel or react?</li> <li><strong>Ethical issues</strong> - Are there any specific ethical issues that require separate consideration?</li></ul> <p><strong>4.9</strong>	Having regard to all of the above, please document:</p> <ul><li>How the decision about the person’s best interests was reached?</li> <li>Why the decision is in the person’s best interests?</li> <li>Who was consulted to help work out best interests?</li> <li>What particular factors were taken in to account?</li> <li>Note any particular conflicts or disagreements regarding the decision. If there is an ongoing dispute or disagreement with the person lacking capacity, or their family, over the best interests decision, then consideration must be given to whether the case should be referred to the Court of Protection (i.e. possible infringements of Article 8 ECHR ‘Right to Privacy and family life).</li> <li>If there are less restrictive options available, give details and explain why these are not being implemented.</li></ul> <p><strong>4.10</strong>	If someone has been deemed as lacking mental capacity in an area you may progress to making a Best Interest decision in this area for the person. This should not be done in isolation and therefore as many people as possible who knows the person well should be involved as above. Please complete the Best Interest Form.</p> <p><strong>4.11</strong>	Review the form at every monthly practice workshop as a minimum or when there is a change in mental capacity noted.</p> <h2 id="_5-the-mental-health-act"><a href="#_5-the-mental-health-act" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 5.	The Mental Health Act</h2> <p><strong>5.1</strong>	The Mental Health Act (MHA) is put in place when someone is at risk of harm to themselves or others due to their mental health symptoms. The Act can be used when a person needs be detained and treated against their wishes in a hospital. Detention under the MHA is also referred to as ‘being sectioned’; this is because there are different sections of the Act that determine whether someone can be detained, treated or both and for what period of time and when this must be reviewed by an independent panel of experts. (See <a href="/Policies/OP07Appendix03.html">Appendix 3</a> for details of the most commonly used sections)</p> <p><strong>5.2</strong>	People detained under the MHA Section 3 Treatment Order are eligible under section 117 of the act to free aftercare.  The local authority in which a person lived when detained will be responsible for funding the after care until such time as they move and the funding transfers to another authority.</p> <p><strong>5.3</strong>	People with mental health needs who have been in hospital should be cared for under the Care Programme Approach (CPA); this means that they should have a care coordinator who will ensure their care is reviewed at least once every six to twelve months. People we support may still be under the CPA process and we will be required to support people to be involved in their reviews as much as is possible.</p> <p><strong>5.4</strong>	Most people we support will have been detained under the MHA and it is important for staff to understand what restriction have previously been put on someone. For some people a Community Treatment Order (CTO) will be put in place before they leave hospital. This order places some restrictions on a person like where they will live and get their treatment.  It means that they can be recalled back to hospital if they get unwell.</p> <p><strong>5.5</strong>	Courts can also apply certain sections of the MHA to impose restrictions which determines that someone may be required to live in a certain place and be recalled back to hospital. This is a section 41 restriction order.</p> <h2 id="_6-supporting-people-to-make-decisions"><a href="#_6-supporting-people-to-make-decisions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 6.	Supporting people to make decisions</h2> <p><strong>6.1</strong>	It is important to consider the following when supporting people to make decisions:</p> <ul><li>Does the person have all the information they need to make the decision?</li> <li>Have they been given information on all the alternatives available to them?</li> <li>How does the person communicate?</li></ul> <p><strong>6.2</strong>	People can communicate in a variety of ways, including non-verbal. Consider if they need an interpreter/ specialist equipment/ adapted information leaflets such as easy read.</p> <p><strong>6.3</strong>	Have you considered what time of day is best for the person to make a decision? Is there a particular place where the person feels most comfortable? Would they like someone with them to support with this, such as a family member/carer or independent advocate?</p> <p><strong>6.4</strong>	It is essential not to assess someone’s understanding before they have been given relevant information about a decision. Every effort must be made to provide information in a way that is most appropriate to help the person to understand.</p> <p><strong>6.5</strong>	Quick or inadequate explanations are not acceptable unless the situation is urgent. Relevant information includes:</p> <ul><li>The nature of the decision</li> <li>The reason why the decision is needed, and</li> <li>The likely effects of deciding one way or another, or making no decision at all.</li></ul> <p><strong>6.6</strong>	It is important for staff to be clear that mental capacity is a decision and time specific. A person may therefore be able to make a decision about having their blood pressure taken but they may lack
capacity in relation to their prescribed medication for their hypertension.</p> <h2 id="_7-consent"><a href="#_7-consent" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 7.	Consent</h2> <p><strong>7.1</strong>	It is standard for all people that they are assumed to have capacity to consent to treatment and care and vocalise or put in writing when they are choosing not to engage in any given aspect. More invasive and medical procedures can require written consent and even if a person is detained under the MHA they cannot be made to have procedures like ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy) without written consent or having been assessed by an independent doctor known as a Second Opinion Appointed Doctor (SOAD).</p> <p><strong>7.2</strong>	An assessment of capacity for receipt of medical interventions should be completed at any time where there is a concern that the person we support may not be able to make an informed decision. The team will discuss the best person to lead on the MC assessment, which is completed using the MCA Assessment Form. This should then be checked by a healthcare professional at the earliest opportunity and signed off.</p> <p><strong>7.3</strong>	It is standard practice for care services to request consent to share information, this is covered in our G05 Data Protection Policy. However, if they cannot consent due to MCA issues this must be recorded on the assessment of capacity form and checked by a healthcare professional at the earliest opportunity and signed off.</p> <h2 id="_8-roles-and-responsibilities"><a href="#_8-roles-and-responsibilities" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> 8.	Roles and Responsibilities</h2> <p><strong>8.1</strong>	The Operations Director has overall responsibility for the delivery of best practice in MHA, MCA, BI and DoLS processes and safeguards and delegates at service level this responsibility to the Team Manager.</p> <p><strong>8.2</strong>	The Team Managers are required to ensure their teams are fully trained in the areas of this policy and related processes.</p> <p><strong>8.3</strong>	All staff are required to understand their responsibility in identifying that when a restriction on a person we support is made there are strict guidelines on how this is agreed and documented onto the electronic notes. They need to be aware of the MHA and how a CTO may impact on someone’s liberty and they need to know when they are acting unlawfully if MCA, BI and DoLS processes have not been followed and what to do if they see someone else acting outside of this policy.</p> <hr> <h3 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Further Reading:</h3> <ul><li><p><a href="/Policies/OP07Appendix01.html">Appendix 1 - Glossary of terms</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/Policies/OP07Appendix02.html">Appendix 2 - Useful links and supporting information</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/Policies/OP07Appendix03.html">Appendix 3 - The Mental Health Act 1983- frequently used acts</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/Policies/OP07Appendix04.html">Appendix 4 - MCA decision process</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/Policies/OP07Appendix05.html">Appendix 5 - Scenarios</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/Policies/OP07Appendix06.html">Appendix 6 - Care and Support Planning and MCA</a></p></li></ul></div> <div class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated: </span> <span class="time">11/8/2018, 3:38:46 PM</span></div></div> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
